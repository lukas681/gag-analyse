00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Hello and welcome to a special edition of Geschichten aus der Geschichte. My name is

00:20.320 --> 00:26.880
Richard and today I have a special guest and it's a special guest some of you may actually

00:26.880 --> 00:35.040
know because she's been a special guest with us before. Welcome Dr Emma Southern. Hi it's good

00:35.040 --> 00:39.440
to be back. I can't believe it's been two years since the last time I was here, just time flies.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.800
It really does and the last time you were here we were talking about a book of yours and today

00:47.360 --> 00:54.240
we're going to be talking about a book of yours. But let me just introduce you a bit more because

00:54.240 --> 01:02.720
you are a writer and you also are a podcaster. You do a podcast called History is Sexy. You do it with

01:03.360 --> 01:09.440
Janina Mathieson, is that correct? That is correct. Good and it's a very good podcast. I enjoy

01:09.440 --> 01:14.800
listening to it. I think the last episode I listened to was the one about pirates.

01:15.840 --> 01:21.920
Oh yeah. I think it's been a while but that is the latest one I listened to. It's very interesting.

01:21.920 --> 01:28.400
Yeah I didn't know we knew so much about pirates until I researched that. That's one of the...

01:30.400 --> 01:37.120
and how horrible being a pirate sounds. Well one could imagine you know. Yeah I suppose if you

01:37.120 --> 01:44.400
thought about it for too long. Living life on the sea is generally not that much fun. Yeah the films make it look

01:44.400 --> 01:52.800
much nicer than it seemed to be. Yeah well if you enjoy killing and pillaging. So it looks very nice

01:52.800 --> 02:00.640
to me. So you do this podcast and yes you wrote a book about which we talked two years ago and

02:00.640 --> 02:08.320
that book was Agrippina, Empress Exile Hustle Whore, the British title. I think they had to kind of

02:08.320 --> 02:17.120
tone it down for the US version. They did. They did. And yeah sorry. No I was gonna say but that's

02:17.120 --> 02:22.640
okay. I always assume that somebody would take that out of the title anyway. Oh well it's the one

02:22.640 --> 02:30.240
you're stuck with here and in our podcast as well. The episode was episode 183 and we released

02:30.240 --> 02:38.560
a full version of the interview three days later and it's still an episode where we still get

02:38.560 --> 02:45.120
very good comments about and good feedback so people really like it. Ah that's nice. Anyway today

02:45.120 --> 02:50.880
we are here to not talk about Agrippina but about your new book and your new book is called

02:50.880 --> 02:58.080
A Fatal Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum Murder in Ancient Rome. Yeah. Now the last couple

02:58.080 --> 03:04.800
of years saw a huge surge of podcasts and I think half of those podcasts came. True crime.

03:04.800 --> 03:12.480
Yeah. True crime podcasts. So I think you're really going with the zeitgeist here. Yeah that's

03:12.480 --> 03:17.680
how the book came about to be honest because a lot of I was talking about true crime podcasts

03:17.680 --> 03:23.840
with a friend of mine and you know the appeal of true crime in general and one of the things that

03:23.840 --> 03:30.320
we both find really interesting about kind of murders and serial killers and horrible events

03:30.320 --> 03:35.840
that happen in today's world is the insight that they give us into the cultures that we live in and

03:35.840 --> 03:44.400
the cultures of the recent past of the 20th century and how certain types of murder can

03:44.400 --> 03:50.560
happen in certain contexts and certain types of murder can be allowed to happen and some are

03:50.560 --> 03:56.240
considered to be much worse than other types and how that gives you a really interesting insight

03:56.240 --> 04:01.600
into the culture and the time and I thought oh I bet someone's written a really good book about this

04:01.600 --> 04:09.600
from a Roman context and kind of Roman crime and Roman murder and what it tells us about the Romans

04:09.600 --> 04:14.560
and it turned out that no one had so I decided that I would write it just so that I could research it.

04:14.560 --> 04:20.800
Yeah someone has to do it. So yeah and it turns out that it really does tell us a lot about Roman

04:20.800 --> 04:26.640
culture and how Romans thought about life and death and who is important and who is not important

04:26.640 --> 04:35.920
and when violence is okay and when it's not and how that changes over the centuries and it ended

04:35.920 --> 04:43.840
up being really interesting. I can attest to that. I mean I read it and it's a very interesting book.

04:43.840 --> 04:51.280
You divided it in various subchapters so you have like the first subchapter is on the senate floor

04:51.840 --> 04:59.760
and then you have things like family and marriage or when you kill an emperor so you already did

04:59.760 --> 05:09.760
some division into different types of murders there which I find really interesting because

05:09.760 --> 05:16.400
like on the surface obviously it's about a murder but like you said earlier it really gives you this

05:16.400 --> 05:22.080
insight into so many different things. I mean you mentioned the and I'm talking specifically about

05:22.080 --> 05:31.520
your book now you mentioned the culture but in many of your episodes that you detail in the book

05:31.520 --> 05:39.520
you get insight into the states or into the state or into the the machinations of the powerful

05:39.520 --> 05:46.640
or the not so powerful or those who want to be powerful etc. So I think to me this obviously on

05:46.640 --> 05:52.960
the on the surface it's about murder but really it's about people isn't it? Yeah it is and that's

05:52.960 --> 06:00.080
you know murder at the end of the day is how we morally define one person killing another person

06:01.200 --> 06:07.440
and that is a like a very intimate act between two people that occurs and what drives somebody

06:07.440 --> 06:11.440
to do that and why they do it and then what happens afterwards are all basically about

06:12.240 --> 06:19.280
human desires and it turns out that they're largely the same selfishness and greed and

06:20.800 --> 06:28.080
a desire to get away with something. So what would you say is special about

06:29.760 --> 06:35.840
murder in ancient Rome when you compare it to let's say the plethora of true crime that you

06:35.840 --> 06:42.800
have about the 20th century in our society? The main thing that immediately leaps out to you when

06:42.800 --> 06:50.720
you're looking at it is that when we look at true crime or look at crime in the 20th 21st century

06:50.720 --> 06:59.120
it's always through the frame of civilians and police and it is the responsibility of the police

06:59.120 --> 07:06.400
to solve crimes and prosecute them and there is this whole structure of the state which exists

07:06.400 --> 07:13.680
to enter people's largely domestic private disputes because most murders are over something

07:13.680 --> 07:21.760
personal and to enter those and then turn them into a state matter and be interested in them

07:21.760 --> 07:28.800
and resolve them to the satisfaction of everybody and in the Roman world that just doesn't exist

07:28.800 --> 07:34.240
there is no separate state apparatus with the responsibility to resolve stuff. It is an entirely

07:34.240 --> 07:41.200
self-help society which means if you want to resolve something like a murder then it is up to

07:41.200 --> 07:48.400
you and your extended circle of family and friends to resolve it and if you have access to

07:50.320 --> 07:54.720
the structures of the state so if you have access to the courts or if you have access to

07:54.720 --> 08:01.120
your local governor then you can ask them to make a decision about what should happen but

08:01.120 --> 08:06.880
they're never going to come and send someone to deal with it for you and what that means is that

08:06.880 --> 08:14.720
so much of everyday crime and murder, calling it crime is wrong because what that means is that

08:14.720 --> 08:18.960
for a large proportion of the Roman world for the pretty much the entire republic it's not

08:18.960 --> 08:25.360
technically a crime to kill somebody because it's not something that the state legislates against

08:25.360 --> 08:31.600
it is a personal interpersonal issue that the family deals with and that is dealt with on a

08:31.600 --> 08:38.320
personal private level so it's technically not a crime. It's not exactly encouraged but it's not

08:38.320 --> 08:45.680
something that the state has any interest in whatsoever and it's not until you start getting

08:45.680 --> 08:52.160
structures which center around a single person that they start trying to really erode away that

08:54.160 --> 08:59.920
that privacy of the family and turn it into a more public institution and also start to control

08:59.920 --> 09:07.120
who can commit violence that it becomes a more of a crime but even then there is no state apparatus

09:07.120 --> 09:12.240
which is going to come in and do it and there's nowhere nobody taking notes on who is killing who

09:12.240 --> 09:19.600
it is entirely a matter for you to deal with as an individual and so we only see the crimes that

09:19.600 --> 09:26.400
really really cause an enormous disturbance in the fabric of society crimes which are either

09:27.120 --> 09:37.280
really really scandalous or really really grotesque in some way or that genuinely impress people to

09:37.280 --> 09:43.920
such an extent that someone writes them down or we see them where people have managed to leave a

09:43.920 --> 09:49.760
little mark on mostly on tombstones where people will say this is a tombstone of my daughter who is

09:49.760 --> 09:57.120
murdered and you get to see like that tiny little bit of justice that they got but there is no

09:57.840 --> 10:05.440
overarching sense that that violence and murder is something that the Romani community is

10:05.440 --> 10:11.440
something that the Roman government is involved in and no one seems to think that they should be

10:11.440 --> 10:20.480
either. Do you think that it is somewhat connected to sort of a feeling that people who are not part

10:20.480 --> 10:28.240
of the one percent are somewhat dispensable? Yes it is. It's partly that there's two things that

10:28.240 --> 10:34.080
come together partly it's that everything in Rome is underpinned by slavery from the very beginning

10:34.080 --> 10:41.680
it is underpinned by slavery and people who have been brought in from outside who are mostly have

10:41.680 --> 10:46.880
been captured in war and been stripped of their humanity they are what is called socially dead

10:46.880 --> 10:53.920
they are already dead basically and they are not seen as people and then as the empire grows as

10:53.920 --> 11:02.480
Rome gets richer the whole thing is economically and practically underpinned by just millions of

11:02.480 --> 11:11.520
enslaved people who are ground up by the Roman empire and they are everywhere but they are not

11:11.520 --> 11:18.800
people legally or morally they you cannot harm if you you cannot harm a slave in the same way that

11:18.800 --> 11:23.680
you can hurt a person because they don't have anything attached to them worth hurting you hurt

11:23.680 --> 11:30.560
a slave in the same way that you hurt a table like it just doesn't register on a moral level

11:30.560 --> 11:37.840
that they're particularly people and once you have that where you are you can stand next to a person

11:37.840 --> 11:41.520
for your whole life you can raise them from a child because a lot of people were born in slavery

11:41.520 --> 11:48.800
but see them as property then that automatically means that you have had to find a way to apply

11:48.800 --> 11:53.920
meaning to human life that doesn't it is not related to the fact that they're just a human

11:53.920 --> 11:59.040
like they know that they're people they know that they're human they know they have feelings and

11:59.040 --> 12:06.320
hurt themselves but in order to make it so that it is okay for those people to be killed and beaten

12:06.320 --> 12:14.560
and and enslaved you have to say that therefore life is worth something because it has something

12:14.560 --> 12:21.360
else and what they have is fama which is like your reputation and honor um so your prestige

12:21.360 --> 12:29.280
so like what other people say about you and your function and importance to the wider society and

12:29.280 --> 12:35.760
the more of that you have the more your life is worth so a consul is worth more than an a deal

12:35.760 --> 12:42.240
who is worth more than an equestrian who is worth more than um your random bookseller on the street

12:42.240 --> 12:48.480
um who is always worth more than a slave and you have that and then on the other hand you have the

12:48.480 --> 12:57.920
fact that rome is fundamentally a set of tribes basically like big family units who all work

12:57.920 --> 13:07.360
together and intermarry but are connected by obligation and counter obligation and feud and

13:07.360 --> 13:15.520
that is where most of the dealings of life go on is at that level of of families talking to families

13:15.520 --> 13:23.120
rather than at a political or state level um and for the republican period certainly

13:23.680 --> 13:30.720
up until augustus they nobody wants to mess with that and augustus starts to change it

13:30.720 --> 13:38.800
um by interfering with the family a bit um but it takes a long time for for that structure

13:38.800 --> 13:46.560
that tribal kind of structure to break down into more individual concerns whereby the state can

13:46.560 --> 13:51.920
be involved in an individual's behavior rather than the father or a kind of a group of elder men

13:51.920 --> 13:59.680
being responsible for your behavior what you said about the um the tribes and the families being

13:59.680 --> 14:05.760
sort of the the one thing you basically live for right or yeah let's say the the farmer you have the

14:05.760 --> 14:11.600
and your honor and your family so these are the two things like honor on an individual level and

14:11.600 --> 14:18.400
family on a less individual level so you always want to further the fame of your family and your

14:18.400 --> 14:23.760
own correct yeah so if you get to be a consort then you then get to pass that down to your

14:23.760 --> 14:28.000
children and your grandchildren that they are now the children and grandchildren of a console

14:28.000 --> 14:33.760
and if your great grandfather was a console then you can you know you can haul that family mask out

14:33.760 --> 14:39.280
at any given time um and you get a special favor because you are your great grandfather was a

14:39.280 --> 14:44.160
console and now you have to try and live up to him and it's all that's all interconnected down

14:44.160 --> 14:49.760
the line going back generations forever and that i think is often overlooked when you look at roman

14:49.760 --> 14:57.680
culture that that importance of the the clan and the gens um an individual and how the individual

14:57.680 --> 15:04.400
and how the individual works within that and when it comes to things like murder is a kind of a

15:04.400 --> 15:10.560
closed ranks thing if your son kills somebody then you're not going to want that broadcast to the

15:10.560 --> 15:16.320
world because that is something that you know in famio is also going to follow you down the

15:16.320 --> 15:20.320
generation so you're going to close ranks you're going to try and deal with it on a person to

15:20.320 --> 15:25.600
person family to family level and hope that nobody else finds out too much about it which

15:25.600 --> 15:32.080
uh is interesting when you talk about how how important it is to keep the family intact and to

15:32.080 --> 15:37.120
keep it intact for your children because in your first chapter you mentioned or you mentioned you

15:37.120 --> 15:45.280
you write about uh publius claudius pulcher who basically let himself be adopted by by another

15:45.280 --> 15:52.160
family so he could become a tribune yeah he does he gives up the claudian name like one of the most

15:52.160 --> 16:01.760
ancient and um prestigious patrician names that connects him back god knows how many generations

16:01.760 --> 16:10.160
back to um publius claudius pulcher's uh going about 400 years it's so that he could become a

16:10.160 --> 16:16.080
plebeian so that he could become the tribune of the plebs which gave him veto over the senate

16:16.080 --> 16:21.360
and meant that he could kind of build up his own little cult of personality and it's a really

16:21.360 --> 16:27.840
interesting point because it's one of the first times that in this late republican period somebody

16:28.480 --> 16:34.240
is doing something for themselves not for any great familial glory but just because they want

16:34.240 --> 16:41.840
this immediate personal gain that they can get in this lifetime and they don't care at all about the

16:42.640 --> 16:46.320
repercussions for their family or their repercussions for their hypothetical future

16:46.320 --> 16:54.240
children yeah it's really fascinating because i wasn't aware of the extent of of the family being

16:54.240 --> 17:00.800
sort of this this uh factor of identification and what a huge scandal it must have been to just give

17:00.800 --> 17:10.240
up that name especially one as big as claudius is like a walking scandal to be but everything he does

17:10.240 --> 17:17.840
um and his sister as well who is very close to claudia they are just a walking scandal everything

17:17.840 --> 17:23.040
they do he dresses up as a woman so that he can break into a female only religious right

17:23.040 --> 17:30.320
he's always he just lies openly to people he then starts his own paramilitary he is just he is

17:30.320 --> 17:37.280
he's a nasty piece of work but i mean it's how you described him you you're like um you wouldn't like

17:37.280 --> 17:44.080
him but um you're in awe of of him being this anecdote machine yeah he is an anecdote machine

17:45.680 --> 17:51.280
because everything he does is extraordinary um and he wouldn't if he was a politician and i had to

17:51.280 --> 17:57.360
live under him i would absolutely hate him and i would you know be writing letters to my mp about

17:57.360 --> 18:04.560
him constantly but he's just such a kind of cape swirling obvious villain who doesn't really seem

18:04.560 --> 18:12.880
to care what anybody thinks of him at all and will do anything for the adulation of the kind

18:12.880 --> 18:23.120
of people of rome including giving up being a patrician um and he leads like the period of his

18:23.120 --> 18:28.560
power is a period of just people dying in the streets because they're being beaten so that they

18:28.560 --> 18:35.280
will vote in the right direction um and it's just like hugely bloody and violent and horrendous but

18:35.280 --> 18:43.680
from the uh from the distance of 2000 years you can look back and just be like my god yeah i mean

18:43.680 --> 18:49.920
that's that is what is afforded to us by history you know it is if after a few couple of hundred

18:49.920 --> 18:55.520
years you can really look back and appreciate it's like bad form if you laugh about someone

18:55.520 --> 19:00.240
who died yesterday but if you laugh about someone who died 2000 years ago it's like okay yeah

19:00.240 --> 19:07.520
it's a funny episode there's a line somewhere where it becomes okay to find it funny all right

19:08.320 --> 19:14.320
since you were talking about these um these violent mobs should we dive into the beginning

19:14.320 --> 19:19.680
of your book where you talk about murder on the senate floor and i'd love to talk about

19:19.680 --> 19:28.960
um this first episode you wrote about tiberius graxos because there were um there were riots

19:28.960 --> 19:36.480
in this story as well not with armed gangs as with um with claudius but still there was a quite a bit

19:36.480 --> 19:43.840
of writing going on or brawling going on would you mind just giving a quick rundown of who tiberius

19:43.840 --> 19:50.080
graxos was because from what i got there's not too much to say about him that is as funny or as

19:50.080 --> 19:57.360
interesting apart from the fact that he was involved in this murder which you know was his own

19:58.000 --> 20:12.160
in the end yeah so he is a politician in um the about 130 bce um he is a from a plebeian but

20:12.160 --> 20:21.600
extremely um extremely ancient family um and particularly on his from his mother's side he

20:21.600 --> 20:27.920
the patrician the cornelian they're the um skipios they have conquered carthage and

20:27.920 --> 20:37.360
um done all kinds of things are very important and he is the older of two sons um and he becomes very

20:37.360 --> 20:43.120
interested in land reform um this is why i say that he is one of the more boring members of his

20:43.120 --> 20:50.560
family the rest of his family um are worlds of anecdotes but um he becomes very and genuinely

20:50.560 --> 20:57.120
interested in land reform and land reform is something which has bothered the romans since

20:57.120 --> 21:02.800
pretty much the beginning of the republic um certainly since they started expanding whereby

21:02.800 --> 21:09.600
rich people buy have been buying up italy as they have conquered more and more of italy they have

21:09.600 --> 21:15.280
the rich have bought it up um and they what they are supposed to be doing is giving it to

21:15.280 --> 21:22.560
landless people um and they have often been stealing it from the state stealing it from one

21:22.560 --> 21:28.960
another stealing it from uh things which are supposed to be rented to poor people so that they

21:28.960 --> 21:35.600
can rent a couple of acres of land um the like land barons basically have rented it to themselves

21:35.600 --> 21:44.400
uh in perpetuity um and it's been a problem that's been going on for a good 300 years and has come

21:44.400 --> 21:52.480
up and people have said we need to um take this land when the government needs to basically have

21:52.480 --> 21:59.120
an amnesty take all the land back and then redistribute it um and it has been constantly

21:59.600 --> 22:08.080
unpopular amongst the senate and very very popular amongst the uh the kind of disenfranchised of rome

22:08.080 --> 22:12.400
um and of italy because there's a lot of people throughout italy who've basically had the romans

22:12.400 --> 22:17.760
show up over the past few hundred years steal all their stuff steal all their land and leave them

22:17.760 --> 22:25.680
leave them um with nothing uh so this comes up every time it has ended with somebody being tried

22:25.680 --> 22:33.840
with it being voted down um tiberius brings it up again and he becomes the tribune of the plebs

22:33.840 --> 22:40.400
and the tribune of the plebs is a position which is supposed to uh speak for the speak for the rights

22:40.400 --> 22:46.000
of the plebeians against the patricians maybe trust so people know what we're talking about here

22:46.000 --> 22:51.200
um anyone who's not familiar so you have the plebeians and you have the patricians and

22:51.200 --> 22:58.320
the patricians are the old rich families and the plebeians are somewhat not as rich not as old it's

22:58.320 --> 23:04.960
a basically a a status signifier whereby the patrician families are those who were originally

23:05.520 --> 23:14.880
chosen to be part of romulus's um court so his advice set of advisors uh so they descend from

23:14.880 --> 23:20.480
the very beginning of rome and then other people have been granted patrician status along the way

23:20.480 --> 23:26.000
for specific things but they are they're like the aristocracy the ancient aristocracy

23:26.560 --> 23:34.320
um and they wear like special shoes and they get um like extra colors and special rings and

23:34.320 --> 23:40.480
stuff which denotes their status and there was a big what's called the conflict of the orders

23:40.480 --> 23:45.680
whereby the patricians had everything in terms of power and the plebeians had nothing so there was

23:45.680 --> 23:52.800
a an uprising and the tribune of the plebs was instituted to be the spokesperson for the plebeians

23:52.800 --> 23:57.040
in this like for the senate and they have the right to override the senate and they have all

23:57.040 --> 24:06.480
kinds of special privileges um now tiberius gracus is more interested in land reform than his previous

24:06.480 --> 24:14.560
people uh the previous people who have attempted to do it um and he is willing to use his power to

24:14.560 --> 24:21.680
force it through in a way that previously people haven't and he proposes a bunch of things like

24:21.680 --> 24:28.960
commissions in order to decide learn who owns everybody's all of the land um take it all in

24:28.960 --> 24:34.400
and then divvy it up so that everybody owns pretty much exactly the same amount of land so everybody

24:34.400 --> 24:41.840
gets about 350 acres which is a massive jump for a lot of people but a massive cut for a lot of

24:41.840 --> 24:49.840
others and the senate there is a there's a an economic barrier to being in the senate you have

24:49.840 --> 24:55.040
to have a certain amount of money like a million sesterces um so you have to you literally have to

24:55.040 --> 25:00.640
be amongst the one percent in order to be in the senate that's self-selectingly the richest people

25:00.640 --> 25:09.760
in rome have all of the power and what occurs is a series of votes that tiberius tries to put through

25:10.480 --> 25:19.600
that um continually devolve because the senate and other tribunes keep intervening um so like he will

25:19.600 --> 25:25.360
call a vote and people flood in from italy in order to vote in these um in these things because

25:25.360 --> 25:29.680
basically someone said to them would you like some free land and they're like would you like to come

25:29.680 --> 25:34.400
and vote on whether you can have some free land i think in your book you uh you called it he bust

25:34.400 --> 25:43.280
in people yeah um they you know they were rounding people up to bring them in to vote and on the other

25:43.280 --> 25:50.080
side all of the the richer side of rome is hanging around in their dinner parties a lot of this land

25:50.080 --> 25:55.360
has been in their families for generations um you know they've got it in a dowry they've inherited

25:55.360 --> 26:02.240
it from their grandfather they've bought it legally off of somebody um who inherited it from someone

26:02.240 --> 26:07.200
else and as far as their concern this is land that means something to them that's been in their

26:07.200 --> 26:13.200
family for generations and now tiberius is going to come and take it away so it's very very fraught

26:13.200 --> 26:20.080
um and this is all occurring at a time when rome is richer than it's ever been before

26:20.080 --> 26:28.080
um and where it's starting to absorb absorb territory by osmosis basically people are so

26:28.080 --> 26:35.680
terrified of the romans in the east mostly um that when they die they are handing their

26:35.680 --> 26:43.120
territory over to the romans so that their people won't have to suffer a roman siege or the roman

26:43.120 --> 26:51.520
army entering so they um at this point they get pergamon um and and so tensions are very very high

26:51.520 --> 26:58.080
and roman's very very rich and everybody wants something out of it and there's a few votes which

26:58.080 --> 27:03.760
have to be called off because um they just descend into chaos people won't let the votes go through

27:03.760 --> 27:12.000
and people bring violence in until the final vote occurs it is in fact tiberius is running for

27:12.000 --> 27:17.280
reelection and they he's they've basically managed to put him off for a full year he's now running

27:17.280 --> 27:23.920
for reelection the vote which is happening kind of in the campus marshes is going very badly as it

27:23.920 --> 27:30.560
has been for the entire previous year but it looks like tiberius is going to win um as the votes come

27:30.560 --> 27:35.440
in people vote orally singularly like and they're totting up and it looks like tiberius is going to

27:35.440 --> 27:42.960
win the senate meanwhile is holding an emergency um an emergency meeting in a temple and are

27:42.960 --> 27:47.680
discussing what they're going to do about it because if tiberius gets through if he has another

27:47.680 --> 27:53.120
mandate to do his land redistribution then there's a very distinct possibility that he genuinely is

27:53.120 --> 27:59.040
going to take their land away yeah um and they start suggesting that maybe they just murder him

27:59.040 --> 28:06.160
and that would solve all of their problems before we go on from here because we are reaching sort of

28:07.280 --> 28:13.680
the culmination of that tale already one thing i just like for you to clarify because you do it so

28:13.680 --> 28:18.720
well in the book tiberius grakos he just he didn't just do this out of the kindness of his heart

28:18.720 --> 28:25.920
right i mean there he there was a there was a need for land distribution there is only because

28:25.920 --> 28:32.880
what you have is a whole lot of people who are very disenfranchised and who genuinely have had

28:33.440 --> 28:38.800
everything taken away from them um who are either living on rented land or who are living

28:39.680 --> 28:45.680
like on no land and and the other issue that you have is at this point the roman army

28:46.240 --> 28:51.360
um still technically requires people to be land owners and also promises people land

28:51.360 --> 28:56.480
um when they come out of the army it's a bit of a catch-22 isn't it

28:57.920 --> 29:04.160
you're promised land but you have to have land in order to um even serve the deal is that if you

29:04.160 --> 29:09.680
serve in the army then you will be given some land of your own once you come out so you serve your

29:09.680 --> 29:16.480
like i um i think it's quite short at this time it's 16 years by the time you get to augustus but

29:16.480 --> 29:21.440
it's short definitely shorter than that here but you serve your time and then you can leave you can

29:21.440 --> 29:28.400
have some italian land you can settle down um and you can be secure and there is no land to give

29:28.400 --> 29:35.360
people right now they're giving away land in other places but a lot of roman citizens don't want to

29:35.360 --> 29:44.960
be i don't want to be going off and living in pergamon um so there is very little time to

29:44.960 --> 29:52.160
go out and so there is very much a need for both the people of rome and for the armies of rome to

29:52.160 --> 29:59.200
that the the city has land to give people and also so much of italian land is being taken up

29:59.200 --> 30:05.680
now by pleasure rather than farmland and because it's being owned by a limited number of people

30:06.640 --> 30:13.840
they're using that land primarily for things like wine and for their own pleasure gardens

30:13.840 --> 30:21.200
and so they're using that land rather than using it for food and italy is losing the ability to feed

30:21.200 --> 30:28.480
itself and this is a long time before they get egypt and the bread basket um so there is a

30:28.480 --> 30:35.120
desperate need for them to um to be able to grow stuff as well if they can have a population that

30:35.120 --> 30:42.640
feeds itself then that's a benefit uh to everybody unfortunately you tell that to somebody that you

30:42.640 --> 30:48.080
garden and give it to 25 soldiers so that they can grow some subsistence vegetables and they did not

30:48.080 --> 30:54.960
take it particularly well of course the long-term ramifications did not uh they did not really care

30:55.600 --> 31:01.680
i mean it's um it's interesting because you the way you framed it earlier was that a lot of those

31:01.680 --> 31:08.240
people who owned or had this land uh for some reason or another they had this sense of entitlement

31:08.240 --> 31:14.400
right it was not that they they most of them probably didn't even think there's something

31:14.400 --> 31:19.920
wrong about them occupying that land basically they as far as they were concerned it was land

31:19.920 --> 31:26.240
that had come to them legitimately like um we're well past a period where italy has been conquered

31:26.800 --> 31:34.960
so it's been 250 years odd since um most of this land was taken by the romans and since it has been

31:34.960 --> 31:41.920
entering roman families and so it's been generations worth of this land being passed around

31:41.920 --> 31:48.080
and as far as each individual sitting in the senate is concerned this is land that belongs to

31:48.080 --> 31:52.640
them it belongs to their wife their grandfather gave it to them they bought it legitimately from

31:52.640 --> 32:00.080
rufus down the road uh and so as far as they're concerned it's like like someone's going to come

32:00.080 --> 32:07.120
into your house and take away your xbox and they're they're furious about it it's like it's not just

32:07.920 --> 32:15.760
that they're taking away their their money because land is like the basis of of so much of wealth

32:15.760 --> 32:23.280
um especially within italy italian land is um much like owning property in like new york or london

32:23.280 --> 32:31.600
like it is um of astronomical value and so it's not just taking away their wealth but it's also

32:32.160 --> 32:40.000
taking away something that belongs to them that is theirs that their granddad once used a thousand

32:40.000 --> 32:45.120
slaves to farm and now they use a thousand slave to farm it and so it is very much they do very

32:45.120 --> 32:51.200
much feel like he is trying to snatch something out of their hands like take their family jewels

32:51.200 --> 32:56.880
or steal their firstborn child and i mean that again plays into the whole gotta keep the family

32:56.880 --> 33:03.600
name intact yeah big and whatnot and if you suddenly your wealth is slashed because half or

33:03.600 --> 33:09.520
two thirds or whatnot of your land is taken away then that has an impact on the on the farmer of

33:09.520 --> 33:14.640
your family right yeah you know and it's potentially going to impact people's

33:15.680 --> 33:19.920
right to be in the senate as well if you need a certain amount of money in order to be in there

33:19.920 --> 33:25.520
and the land is capped in that then um and for people who are hanging on the edge if you take

33:25.520 --> 33:30.480
away half their land then potentially you're knocking them out of the senate right so the the

33:31.040 --> 33:38.000
the whole issue was huge for everyone i mean it's it's not like just one new law or something it's

33:38.000 --> 33:44.000
like it would have been a a formative law would have changed the whole political landscape as well

33:44.000 --> 33:52.400
and and change the landscape of the whole of italy literal literal landscape and would be a really

33:52.400 --> 33:57.600
big deal it would change rome it would change italy it would change the lives of thousands of

33:57.600 --> 34:03.840
people it would undermine the wealth inequality that exists in rome whereby a small number of

34:03.840 --> 34:08.480
people have an awful lot and a lot of people have absolutely nothing right and you know and this is

34:08.480 --> 34:12.320
a place where they haven't introduced the corn doll yet but they're about to um

34:12.320 --> 34:18.400
um because they literally have to feed people who are starving to death in the streets because

34:18.400 --> 34:25.680
there's the that's not possible for people to feed themselves really so it's super emotive and

34:26.320 --> 34:36.080
it is a time when we are teetering into violence being a part of roman politics as usual and this

34:36.080 --> 34:42.640
starts in the when elections are going on where everybody goes down and lines up in their centuries

34:42.640 --> 34:46.560
and then walks in to cast their vote and everybody has to go down and spend the whole damn day

34:47.200 --> 34:54.240
hanging out in a field to vote and listen to a load of speeches and that often because when

34:54.240 --> 35:00.960
you've got thousands of people in a hot field and listening to speeches voting on emotive issues

35:00.960 --> 35:07.440
that often turned into shoving and pushing and then that often became quite violent and during

35:07.440 --> 35:13.440
this time as we enter the late republic it starts to become deliberately violent where people are

35:13.440 --> 35:19.520
deliberately provoking like people in the senate are deliberately provoking violence amongst the

35:19.520 --> 35:24.880
voters which is how stuff is kicking on in the initial vote so the votes for the commission

35:24.880 --> 35:33.120
which passes and then votes for various other things that tiberius tries to pass that they

35:33.120 --> 35:39.120
become very violent and that's how the senate is stopping them from passing and sometimes they kick

35:39.120 --> 35:45.200
off by themselves because there's two two tribunes and they can veto one another so his other tribune

35:45.200 --> 35:51.600
quite regularly will step forward and say no don't speak you i beaten and then the people in the crowd

35:51.600 --> 36:00.400
you came all this way to vote will kick off yeah um but this is ways in which um the whole thing

36:00.400 --> 36:09.440
has been leading towards violence becoming an everyday part of republican politics and the

36:09.440 --> 36:15.680
point at which tiberius is at this point for tiberius's election is the point at which it then

36:15.680 --> 36:23.280
takes a step up into the highest echelons and it's not just senators and the elite

36:23.920 --> 36:28.240
provoking violence amongst people who don't matter whose names will never be remembered

36:29.040 --> 36:36.080
it is them sitting in a temple talking about whether the easiest way to deal with this problem

36:36.080 --> 36:43.440
is going to be to kill tiberius and for them to do it and that's and that's new yes so that has

36:43.440 --> 36:48.320
not happened like that before because i mean obviously you know we all have this or not we

36:48.320 --> 36:54.880
all you obviously don't because you're the expert but generally um when people think back to to

36:54.880 --> 37:00.080
roman times and uh they think of these stories you you get this feeling that you know it's it's

37:00.080 --> 37:04.880
always been kind of like that if you didn't like someone you just killed them even if it was like

37:04.880 --> 37:12.880
a big political figure but as with everything it had to start somewhere and um you say that this is

37:12.880 --> 37:21.440
basically the point where it becomes okay to basically to in the higher or upper echelons

37:21.440 --> 37:28.080
to talk about killing a political adversary yeah before this you could like there are ways in which

37:28.080 --> 37:34.640
you can legally have somebody executed um and it's super easy in the early republic and into

37:34.640 --> 37:39.760
the mid republic to say that somebody wants to be a king and then have them executed for it and that

37:39.760 --> 37:44.480
happens a fair amount and they try to do that to tiberius they accuse him of wanting to be a king

37:44.480 --> 37:50.480
which basically means people like him too much yeah um but that doesn't go anywhere much to

37:50.480 --> 37:55.200
everybody's frustration probably because he is very clearly not interested in being a king

37:55.200 --> 38:02.080
he is genuinely and very tediously interested in landfall yeah nobody nobody really believes that

38:02.080 --> 38:10.160
he wants to be king right no exactly it just can't like he's so staid and serious and um i mean he's

38:10.160 --> 38:16.560
he's no caesar i mean the season okay i can believe it or even his brother because his brother

38:16.560 --> 38:20.560
guy comes later his brother guy spends all of his time like flinging his toga off his shoulder and

38:20.560 --> 38:27.360
slapping his thigh and um making ludicrous pronouncements and he has a um he has a musician

38:27.360 --> 38:34.800
who follows him everywhere to play thematic music for him uh which is great well your life soundtrack

38:34.800 --> 38:40.240
you need it i know it's just what everyone's always wanted um but tiberius is like the staid older

38:40.240 --> 38:45.040
brother he's very serious he's always trying to be reasonable like throughout all of this he's

38:45.040 --> 38:52.000
always trying to explain to people why it's good for them um but he um you know why it's good for

38:52.000 --> 38:58.240
rome in general why it's good for the glory of rome that we can do this so it's just unconvincing

38:58.240 --> 39:03.840
that he wants to be king um and so they can't get rid of him that way they can't get him on anything

39:03.840 --> 39:08.480
anything treasonous they can't get him on any of the ways that they would previously have got rid

39:08.480 --> 39:14.800
of somebody so they end up talking about and somehow you know somebody says for the first time

39:14.800 --> 39:18.880
why don't we just kill him and this happens in a senate meeting an official senate meeting in a

39:18.880 --> 39:25.760
religious space and the council says no we can't do that you can't just go around killing people

39:25.760 --> 39:36.560
that's mental um and they argue about the situation the pontifex maximus um is pushing really hard

39:36.560 --> 39:43.200
for the idea so he's like the head priest um of rome he is the idea is that he takes the place

39:43.200 --> 39:48.720
of a king if a king were to exist to do like the religious the religious duties of the king so the

39:48.720 --> 39:54.560
most important religious duties of rome are the pontifex maximus it's technically a kind of

39:54.560 --> 39:59.760
political position because you get elected to it but it's also a very religious position so it is

39:59.760 --> 40:05.760
a bit like the pope um suddenly deciding that he wants to murder somebody okay i mean it's not

40:05.760 --> 40:14.000
unheard of uh the history of it's true history of posts are pretty great but they so they have

40:14.000 --> 40:17.360
they're having this conversation they're going back and forth the council is really against it

40:17.360 --> 40:22.480
um and in order for it to be legal basically they would need the council to say that he was guilty

40:22.480 --> 40:30.800
of something but they are so hyped up and so emotional over the situation and so afraid that

40:30.800 --> 40:37.840
they just stand up and the pontifex maximus stands up and says as the consul is a traitor to the whole

40:37.840 --> 40:44.880
emperor and he won't let the won't protect rome i will and they tear their benches apart and he

40:44.880 --> 40:50.720
shouts let anyone who wants to save the country come with me and the senators march out of the

40:51.440 --> 40:58.560
of the temple and march up to where the election for tiberius is once again in chaos and they

40:58.560 --> 41:06.800
chase him and his friends across the capitoline hill and beat him to death with wood and they

41:06.800 --> 41:12.000
they did that because they weren't allowed to take their swords with them into the senate yeah

41:12.000 --> 41:16.720
so they're not allowed they don't have any swords so they and they're too impatient to wait and they

41:16.720 --> 41:23.680
are absolutely desperate for it to be over immediately as they see them coming it starts

41:23.680 --> 41:31.280
basically a stampede people are trampled to death people are violently beaten with chair legs and

41:31.280 --> 41:39.600
bits of wood and tiberius falls down um at the feet of the statues of the ancient kings and is

41:39.600 --> 41:46.800
just beaten to death by the senate the richest and most austere and the people in charge of running

41:46.800 --> 41:54.480
the whole empire and they do it in a frenzy of pure rage essentially it's not it's not an

41:54.480 --> 42:05.360
assassination of any kind it is a a pure rage fueled like storming and getting rid of him in

42:05.360 --> 42:12.640
the most brutal way they possibly could so the way you you said it just earlier about the uh the

42:12.640 --> 42:20.400
pontifex saying okay we gotta kill him because he's trying to destroy rome etc yeah yeah do you

42:20.400 --> 42:26.480
think they actually believe that uh that i think they probably did destroy the fabric of the empire

42:26.480 --> 42:33.600
not empire uh the fabric of the republic with this reform i think they probably did yeah i think that

42:33.600 --> 42:42.800
they were like so invested in the structure of the the structure of rome as it worked whereby

42:44.400 --> 42:51.520
a lot of people had everything and a lot of people had nothing and that they they also have this very

42:51.520 --> 43:00.560
strong belief that the aristocracy are just better um like they're kind of um very ancient ideally

43:00.560 --> 43:05.360
again fantasy novels that members of the aristocracy their blood is literally better

43:05.360 --> 43:12.160
than everybody else's yeah i mean it's we have that now you know it's yeah i mean i live in the

43:12.160 --> 43:18.960
uk where it's very that's an idea i mean obviously not as prevalent as it was back then but um the

43:18.960 --> 43:25.920
idea is still exists yeah and you see you know i live in as i said in the uk um our government is

43:25.920 --> 43:33.040
currently run by people who are primarily from landed aristocracy of generations past and people

43:33.040 --> 43:37.040
vote for them quite happily because they're extremely passionate there is a general belief

43:37.040 --> 43:41.760
that very people who are landed aristocracy probably just know how to run things better

43:41.760 --> 43:49.040
yeah um and they seem to believe it very strongly too yeah it's a it's kind of kind of a self-fulfilling

43:49.040 --> 43:55.840
prophecy here you know it is nobody else gets to go they wouldn't be in power if they weren't you

43:55.840 --> 44:04.320
know good if they weren't so good at it and evidence be damned um but yeah so they they do

44:04.320 --> 44:08.880
have that belief and you know this is how it's been since romulus and this this another thing

44:08.880 --> 44:13.760
about romans is that they're very into antiquity old things are by their very nature good the older

44:13.760 --> 44:20.560
something is the gooder it is and so if romulus wanted patricians and a senate and if uh this is

44:20.560 --> 44:27.920
how it's always been then you can't change it that would be ridiculous um and changing things is

44:27.920 --> 44:34.640
inherently bad no matter how uh no matter what you are changing they only change things if they

44:34.640 --> 44:40.480
can trick themselves into believing that they're changing it back to how it was so that that is um

44:40.480 --> 44:46.880
that's very ingrained in them as well the just the idea of changing something ancient is is anathema

44:46.880 --> 44:52.560
um so i suspect that they did genuinely believe that they were doing the right thing and the next

44:52.560 --> 44:58.720
day and the days after tiberius's murder when you think they might be maybe wake up in their beds

44:58.720 --> 45:05.600
and think oh my god what did we do they double down quite hard on what they did they defile

45:05.600 --> 45:13.120
tiberius's body and throw it in the river they then exile and execute a bunch of his friends

45:13.120 --> 45:17.200
and just basically try to make it so that land reform is never going to come up again

45:17.760 --> 45:25.280
because this is what is going to happen and they basically convince themselves and write it into

45:25.280 --> 45:31.760
the consequences that they did the right thing they protected the republic he was a traitor and

45:31.760 --> 45:38.160
a threat to the republic and therefore he had to die and what that did was it made it so that as

45:38.160 --> 45:43.360
long as you said oh i'm protecting the republic and possibly if you even believe that you were

45:43.360 --> 45:50.160
protecting the republic killing someone in the political arena could be legitimate you could have

45:50.160 --> 45:59.200
a cast iron defense that said yes i killed him off the bat with no trial by myself with a stick but

45:59.200 --> 46:05.760
he was threatening the republic so that kind of paved the way for the for the next centuries right

46:05.760 --> 46:14.160
or or decades at least yeah until you know right the way down to the that's the reasoning that is

46:14.160 --> 46:20.720
used by brutus and cassius and other brutus when they um kill caesar and that's their reasoning

46:20.720 --> 46:26.880
for not killing antony is well we're protecting the republic and it's the reasoning that cicero

46:26.880 --> 46:31.920
uses when he executes cataline without a trial that he is protecting the republic and everyone

46:31.920 --> 46:36.800
says do you have any got any evidence and he says no you can't have a look at it i did it last night

46:36.800 --> 46:45.520
i've lost it um but um so i definitely that's definitely why i did it would you say that the

46:45.520 --> 46:52.080
the situation um that kind of culminated in the murder of tiberius do you think it would have

46:52.080 --> 46:57.760
come to something similar anyway so that um you know something like like the murder of caesar

46:57.760 --> 47:04.720
would have happened anyway or would you say that without tiberius probably uh the murder of caesar

47:04.720 --> 47:09.600
wouldn't have happened in the way it did i mean obviously that's conjecture because there were

47:09.600 --> 47:14.400
you know a few steps in between and caesar probably wouldn't have existed if things went

47:14.400 --> 47:21.120
differently back then but yeah would you say i suspect it does i think it does pave the way for

47:21.120 --> 47:30.320
the murder of cesar because it is the first time that that like that kind of assassination of

47:30.320 --> 47:39.040
senator on senator violence in such a way and they justify it to themselves and to everyone who is

47:39.040 --> 47:47.760
watching and that then sets you on the path for for what happens to caesar otherwise what you have

47:47.760 --> 47:56.080
is a path of trials and exiles and it was never going to be possible to try or exile caesar

47:56.080 --> 48:03.040
and i suspect that without the legacy of justified political violence that grows in the

48:03.840 --> 48:10.800
late republic caesar if caesar is not assassinated then caesar just makes himself a king

48:10.800 --> 48:18.080
so uh since you mentioned exile and and you mentioned that the next day after tiberius was

48:18.080 --> 48:25.760
killed they had friends of his or family even killed as well would you say that this is was

48:25.760 --> 48:31.280
done so people wouldn't try to take revenge for the murder of tiberius sort of like what people

48:31.280 --> 48:37.600
did when someone was murdered basically they do it so there could be no other no other place for

48:37.600 --> 48:45.040
that populism to coalesce around like there can be nobody else that that can take up his mantle

48:45.040 --> 48:52.240
but there happened to be another one doing it right there was they didn't as they always

48:52.240 --> 48:57.440
overlook someone and they overlooked his brother which is kind of a rookie mistake isn't it i mean

48:58.000 --> 49:04.560
it's his brother yeah uh you think it was obvious but his brother was very young um and it takes a

49:04.560 --> 49:12.160
decade for guys to to enter the political arena and um try to kind of take up his brother's mantle

49:12.800 --> 49:24.800
and he is he's much more uh fiery and is much less reasonable um and he attempt basically

49:24.800 --> 49:31.440
the first sign of dissent uh tries to lead a coup against the senate uh like a military coup

49:31.440 --> 49:37.840
which does not last very long at all because as soon as he has done that he has cast himself

49:37.840 --> 49:43.360
like he literally is an enemy of the republic then there's no backing away from it and so they

49:43.360 --> 49:50.240
just send soldiers in who behead him and everybody he knows uh and they treat it as a violent

49:50.240 --> 49:56.320
attempt to overthrow the republic which is a shame because he could he'd been a bit more reasonable

49:56.320 --> 50:02.560
something different could have happened but he is um he's considerably less patient than his brother

50:02.560 --> 50:12.160
but it is a another incident 10 years later with largely the same people still around um where

50:12.160 --> 50:17.200
again they have to kill somebody in order to and they they chase him down and cut his head off and

50:17.200 --> 50:21.920
then they bring his head back and the person who brought it back gets its weight in gold um but

50:21.920 --> 50:26.640
they you know they hunt him down they behead him they bring it back and it's another time very soon

50:26.640 --> 50:31.520
after where they can say this guy threatened the republic so we killed him we didn't put him on

50:31.520 --> 50:37.680
trial we didn't do anything you know legal around the situation we just we went and dealt with it

50:38.720 --> 50:45.760
so uh tabir is his that his brother is dead end of this story but uh one thing that i'd like to

50:45.760 --> 50:52.480
i'd like to talk about at the end is the sources because you mentioned details about you know the

50:52.480 --> 50:59.520
killing of tabir is like that he falls to the feet of the ancient kings and the way he's bludgeoned

50:59.520 --> 51:06.640
to death etc etc how reliable are these sources that you're taking you know this information from

51:06.640 --> 51:12.240
or can we even talk about reliable in that context it's tough to talk about reliable

51:12.240 --> 51:20.960
um with the romans there but there are two big sources for tiberius and gaius who are a plutarch

51:20.960 --> 51:29.440
they're both writing a long time later um and are actively baffled by uh the republic really

51:30.320 --> 51:35.040
and how roman republic works they are writing in a time when there has not just been emperors but

51:35.040 --> 51:42.480
there's been emperors for 200 years and it is basic and the word caesar means emperor and so

51:43.440 --> 51:48.000
they but it's quite interesting because they you can see where they are trying to honestly

51:48.000 --> 51:52.320
write out what their sources are tell them because they say i don't understand why this happened

51:53.040 --> 52:00.480
um so they when they write about the debate about whether they should kill tiberius while the senate

52:00.480 --> 52:05.440
are all sitting around in the temple apian is really baffled as to why they don't just

52:05.440 --> 52:12.320
make somebody a dictator and then he could do it legally um and why they don't just make why they

52:12.320 --> 52:18.320
don't just make somebody into like a mini emperor basically he's just really baffled and that just

52:18.320 --> 52:25.440
that like you can't just do that in the republic um but so it's apian and plutarch apian um it

52:25.440 --> 52:31.200
writes thing called the civil wars which is uh effectively a long history of the collapse of the

52:32.080 --> 52:37.440
the roman republic through all of the various wars so coming out this one into the social wars with

52:37.440 --> 52:49.120
marius and uh sullar and then into pompi and da da da da da um and plutarch who wrote a series of

52:49.120 --> 52:54.240
biographies called the parallel lives where he took figures from greek history classical greek

52:54.240 --> 53:00.080
history and figures from roman history and kind of tried to match them up so he wrote one of

53:00.080 --> 53:05.840
tiberius gracus which has a lot of the good details in it because he likes a good detail

53:07.360 --> 53:13.280
but they are writing they're writing a long time after and they're writing in a completely

53:13.280 --> 53:19.440
different context and they are genuinely kind of baffled by what is occurring um but they do both

53:19.440 --> 53:24.560
write a really nice narrative um and it matches so they're obviously drawing from the same sources

53:24.560 --> 53:30.800
whatever they're drawing from it's unusual for something to match reasonably well just out of

53:32.000 --> 53:38.960
interests i mean obviously everything here is out of interest but how or where would they get their

53:38.960 --> 53:43.840
sources from i mean are these sources that we just don't know about nowadays because they're lost or

53:43.840 --> 53:51.040
would this be sort of oral tradition or it is lost historians we know the names of quite a lot

53:51.040 --> 53:57.280
of lost historians from various periods that people drew from and they will often say like

53:57.280 --> 54:06.480
you know x says why marius says da da da and um maricius says that but those are sadly lost like

54:06.480 --> 54:11.360
romans really loved writing histories about themselves they enjoyed it a lot particularly

54:11.360 --> 54:16.880
it was a great hobby for senators to sit around and write histories of themselves much in the same

54:16.880 --> 54:23.120
way that it's really popular for historians of uh for british politicians to be historians of the

54:23.120 --> 54:29.920
victorians or you know churchill or whatever like they love to write a history of their own times

54:29.920 --> 54:38.080
and the times that they wish they lived in um but so much of it because it's latin was lost

54:38.080 --> 54:45.200
in the middle ages uh so we know who they were we vaguely know sometimes when they existed

54:46.080 --> 54:52.720
but they're unfortunately lost forever would you i mean um my uh my academic focus was

54:53.360 --> 54:59.360
the early medieval period uh so i'm like on the on the other side of the spectrum because

55:00.160 --> 55:06.800
i have like for my thesis i had two reliable sources basically yeah um yeah i know that

55:06.800 --> 55:12.240
feeling it's somewhat reliable sources and what is it like for someone who does ancient um who

55:12.240 --> 55:18.960
does ancient rome like you do and you have like this huge amount of material to choose from how

55:18.960 --> 55:24.560
how do you do it i tell you it never feels like it's only when you're dealing with this very narrow

55:24.560 --> 55:30.640
period that you have a huge amount of to deal with this and that's why that period is so well known

55:30.640 --> 55:38.800
basically starting here with tiberius through to um the end of the julio claudians is like a really

55:38.800 --> 55:44.240
well known period and that is really really like really well covered and there's multiple sources

55:44.240 --> 55:49.920
for various things some of them are not like tacitus for example who we use for most of the

55:49.920 --> 55:57.920
julio claudians has big chunks missing which is heartbreaking um but um but it's only that

55:57.920 --> 56:06.880
and once you step out of the politics of the of the late republic and early imperial system

56:06.880 --> 56:15.680
and then it's kind of wastelandy oh okay and it's much more like it is for you but it is it's nice

56:15.680 --> 56:19.600
when you have when you get to do something so this is great for me because i don't usually do

56:19.600 --> 56:24.080
write about politics um and i certainly don't write about the politics of the late republic so

56:24.080 --> 56:30.960
i was having so much fun being like i've got five sources for this and i can and they basically

56:30.960 --> 56:38.640
agree with each other this is amazing um but uh so it feels like uh an embarrassment of riches

56:39.280 --> 56:42.560
i don't know how you deal with much one that i always think it's about 20th century historians

56:42.560 --> 56:52.640
where they've got so much like how do you narrow it down all right emma i've taken up a huge chunk

56:52.640 --> 57:00.960
of your time already um thank you so much one thing that um i um just have to mention because

57:02.000 --> 57:07.920
it's been going around my head all through actually reading that book and um and now

57:07.920 --> 57:14.720
talking to you the historian tom holland who blurbed your book as well yeah he he wrote this

57:14.720 --> 57:21.360
book dominion which i'm sure you're familiar with and in an interview he said something interesting

57:21.360 --> 57:27.680
that people are actually when they think of of ancient rome nowadays with you know the senate

57:27.680 --> 57:33.280
and political structures and all this stuff that is kind of like the basis for how we see sort of

57:33.280 --> 57:42.480
you know democracy etc they have this idea of this ideal idea of the romans and that actually

57:42.480 --> 57:49.920
compared to the way we value life nowadays it's really very barbarian and that only the

57:49.920 --> 57:58.240
sort of oh yeah the um christianity or the or christian morality kind of got us where we are

57:58.240 --> 58:04.560
nowadays and people often don't really want to think about that without this we'd still be

58:04.560 --> 58:11.120
living in a time that is very similar to what you're describing in your book yeah it is um it

58:11.120 --> 58:17.440
is like when you look at the legal and moral um like developments around human life it is very

58:17.440 --> 58:25.600
much christianity that um that starts to make people feel differently about it um and it's

58:25.600 --> 58:31.600
constantine who brings in the first law that says you can't just kill a slave for example yeah i'll

58:31.600 --> 58:39.360
never forget when i was a an undergraduate one of my um my lecturers mary harlow talking about the

58:39.360 --> 58:46.400
romans and like the terrible things that they did um and and then just saying and yet they called

58:46.400 --> 58:52.080
other people barbarians right like they will do all this stuff they will crucify people in the

58:52.080 --> 58:57.120
street they will have these monstrous things that they do to one another just as a matter of their

58:57.120 --> 59:07.040
political course they will murder people in their houses on a distressingly regular basis and then

59:07.040 --> 59:12.480
they're just getting cross about trousers like but trousers is the line that's the germanic barbarian

59:12.480 --> 59:20.800
line look at them i mean what kind of people must they be i know they don't even you know murder

59:20.800 --> 59:28.960
people in the arena yeah no it's uh it's fascinating as fascinating as your book is and i'm

59:28.960 --> 59:34.640
just gonna say the name again it's called um a fatal thing happened on the way to the forum

59:34.640 --> 59:41.120
it's a very good book what we talked about now was the first part of the first chapter so yeah

59:41.120 --> 59:48.000
so yeah you get an idea of the the breadth of a material that you can find in this book i mean

59:48.000 --> 59:57.040
you already know it so talking about my audience here um they will um thank you so much for joining

59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.960
me again for an episode it's my pleasure when i write another one i'll come back so it's going

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:11.920
to be in about two years yeah probably good so march 2023 um i suppose we'll still be around then

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:20.400
i hope so great well thank you and um best of luck with you said your book just came out in the us

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:28.800
so um you're you're basically world famous with this book now as well not just with that's the

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:38.320
aim yeah perfect okay so uh thank you very much and um yeah let's um let's talk soon 2023 thank you
