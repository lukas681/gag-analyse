Hallo liebe Hörerinnen und Hörer, wir melden uns kurz aus der Zukunft. Seit Folge 270 heißt

00:06.120 --> 00:11.320
dieser Podcast Geschichten aus der Geschichte. Mehr dazu findet ihr unter Geschichte.fm.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.600
Und jetzt geht's zurück in die Vergangenheit. Viel Spaß.

00:14.600 --> 00:22.080
Lernen ein bisschen Geschichte, lernen ein bisschen Geschichte, dann werden Sie sehen,

00:22.080 --> 00:27.160
wie sich der Reporter damals entwickelt hat. Wie er sich damals entwickelt hat.

00:27.160 --> 00:34.720
Hallo und willkommen zu einem besonderen Episode von Zeitsprung Geschichten aus der Geschichte.

00:34.720 --> 00:42.720
Mein Name ist Richard und meistens würde Daniel sein Name nennen. Aber Daniel ist nicht hier,

00:42.720 --> 00:50.080
weil ich heute einen sehr besonderen Gast habe. Und dieser sehr besondere Gast ist Dr. Emma Southern.

00:50.080 --> 00:53.760
Danke, dass ich meinen Namen auch korrekt nennen konnte.

00:53.760 --> 00:58.200
Wow. Am I? So few people do.

00:58.200 --> 01:03.000
What is a common mispronunciation? People pronounce it south on.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.560
Oh right. No, I don't know. I think I did my research.

01:07.560 --> 01:15.000
That was good research, thank you. Perfect. Right, so Dr. Emma Southern, maybe

01:15.000 --> 01:19.840
I researched you a bit the way someone does research on the internet. So I went to your

01:19.840 --> 01:27.160
website and I found out that you have a PhD in ancient history from the University of

01:27.160 --> 01:34.480
Birmingham. You taught ancient and medieval history for a while until you were fed up

01:34.480 --> 01:43.440
with the grimness of academia. So now you are an independent historian or independent

01:43.440 --> 01:47.760
researcher and you write books.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.640
And I write books, yeah. So I left academia and then I taught writing for a couple of

01:52.640 --> 01:59.040
years. I taught academic writing and then I quit that and I was a freelance writer for

01:59.040 --> 02:05.840
a while and now I sell books during the day and write books at night.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.840
That is a good way of doing it. I mean, better than the other way around.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.600
It is, yeah. You don't want to have to sell books at night.

02:14.600 --> 02:19.440
Even though it probably would be quite nice to write during the day, right?

02:19.440 --> 02:24.240
It would be quite nice, but a night owl, so it works out for me. When I was a freelance

02:24.240 --> 02:27.900
writer I just slept all day and wrote all night, so this works out better.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.160
So now you're even earning money as well.

02:30.160 --> 02:34.800
Yeah, I know. It's a real privilege.

02:34.800 --> 02:42.760
So the reason why you're on this special episode is because of a book you wrote and the book

02:42.760 --> 02:50.440
you wrote is Agrippina, Empress Exile Hustler Whore. I mean, it's a very catchy title already.

02:50.440 --> 02:56.880
It is a very catchy title. Everywhere else has taken that bit of the title off, so in

02:56.880 --> 03:02.560
England it got published with that title and then it's not got that title in America.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.560
Well, go figure.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.560
Unsurprisingly.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.560
But it sounds so good.

03:08.560 --> 03:14.080
It does. And I don't want to spoil the book for anyone here. We're probably going to

03:14.080 --> 03:19.760
spoil it because we're going to be talking about Agrippina quite a bit. But I do want

03:19.760 --> 03:27.880
to spoil the fact that it's a very good book. I read it and there's this phrase people use

03:27.880 --> 03:30.160
when they say something is eminently readable.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.680
Yes, that is a phrase, I know.

03:33.680 --> 03:41.800
And it's not just eminently readable, it's a fun read as well. How should I put it? If

03:41.800 --> 03:48.800
this is the way you teach people to write academically, I only in the future want to

03:48.800 --> 03:51.000
read books written by your students.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.200
Yeah. If I took anything away from you, it should be that it should be. I think that

03:55.200 --> 04:02.160
things, if you want someone to learn from or take anything away from what you've written,

04:02.160 --> 04:07.160
then they should enjoy reading it. They shouldn't feel like they're being lectured. So I tried

04:07.160 --> 04:11.680
to make it feel like it was a nice... the aim was that you would feel like you were

04:11.680 --> 04:17.400
sitting with me in a pub and we were having a nice chat about Agrippina. And I was having

04:17.400 --> 04:23.200
a kind of conversation with you rather than that I was standing in a lecture theatre lecturing

04:23.200 --> 04:27.360
you for hours with boring slides.

04:27.360 --> 04:31.760
Well, I think you quite succeeded there.

04:31.760 --> 04:37.320
I mean, the interesting thing is, and maybe we might touch upon that later on as well,

04:37.320 --> 04:44.000
but it's not just a conversation, sort of a conversation in a book, it's academic as

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
well. You cite your sources, right?

04:46.000 --> 04:54.960
Yeah, absolutely. It's got good rigorous history. I sneak the history in and hopefully people

04:54.960 --> 05:01.720
don't notice too much. So it's in there and quite a lot of it is really like analysis

05:01.720 --> 05:10.880
of the sources because they're so difficult and there's huge gaps in the sources where

05:10.880 --> 05:15.240
you have to work around when you're writing a biography of somebody. So when you look

05:15.240 --> 05:19.760
at how much of the book is telling a story and how much of it is analysing sources, quite

05:19.760 --> 05:24.040
a lot of it is me talking about the sources. But I've kind of tried to do it in such a

05:24.040 --> 05:29.920
way that it doesn't feel like it either undermines the story and it isn't boring. That's the

05:29.920 --> 05:34.720
main thing I wanted. I want it to not be boring. And to be like, most of history, like when

05:34.720 --> 05:38.380
you're a historian, mostly what you do is look at the sources and analyse them and think

05:38.380 --> 05:46.000
really hard about them and look at them from loads of different directions. And that's

05:46.000 --> 05:50.400
the fun bit. That's the bit that gets historians up in the morning to read some more sources

05:50.400 --> 05:58.480
and enjoy them. And I kind of wanted that bit to be fun as well as the bits where people

05:58.480 --> 06:05.800
are kicking their way into rooms and shouting at emperors, which is also very fun. But I

06:05.800 --> 06:12.200
think that history is just, I mean, I love it. I have tried to quit being a historian

06:12.200 --> 06:22.080
three times now and I have attempted to do other careers. And every time I have just

06:22.080 --> 06:26.840
ended up coming back because I love it so much and nothing else makes me want to get

06:26.840 --> 06:31.960
up in the morning and keep doing it. And I love it enough that I have a proper job that

06:31.960 --> 06:36.200
I go to nine to five and then I come home and I sit and do more history because I just

06:36.200 --> 06:42.520
think it's great. And I wanted in my books, I want people to feel how much I love it.

06:42.520 --> 06:46.880
Absolutely. Well, I think judging from your book, you're really good at it too. So it'd

06:46.880 --> 06:48.920
be a shame if you quit it.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.920
That does help.

06:49.920 --> 06:55.960
No, but coming back to what you said about the sources and discussing the sources in

06:55.960 --> 07:01.840
the book and I'm kind of derailing my own concept that I've written down here for this

07:01.840 --> 07:05.920
episode because we are already talking about the sources, but you know, honestly, it's

07:05.920 --> 07:15.600
a really interesting bit to me as well because oftentimes you read a historical book and

07:15.600 --> 07:23.040
there's actually no talk of the sources at all. So everything is presented as fact,

07:23.040 --> 07:28.680
but we all know that. Or people that have studied history, they know that most of this

07:28.680 --> 07:35.720
is interpretation, a lot of it is conjecture and then there's no discussion of the sources

07:35.720 --> 07:41.040
and the way you do it and the way I like to do it when we talk about sources in the podcast

07:41.040 --> 07:49.000
as well is just to show people how, first of all, what the job of a historian is, that

07:49.000 --> 07:52.300
you actually have to analyse the sources and sort of make up your mind whether a source

07:52.300 --> 07:59.300
is trustworthy or whether it's not trustworthy and why certain things are written down and

07:59.300 --> 08:04.720
why certain things are not written down. And I think that you have done very well in the

08:04.720 --> 08:12.840
talk and I think it's sort of one of the cornerstones of the whole telling of the story of Agrippina,

08:12.840 --> 08:19.000
that it's basically a problem you have with the sources and you have to deal with it.

08:19.000 --> 08:28.600
It is. She is a very interesting person in that, when you're looking at the sources,

08:28.600 --> 08:37.400
she dominates certain sections of the sources. So particularly Tacitus is history, the Annals

08:37.400 --> 08:46.160
and later Dio's Roman history. She just dominates these sections and there seems to be so much

08:46.160 --> 08:54.560
about her, but then big chunks of her life are just completely absent and there are entire

08:54.560 --> 09:04.200
decades where we have no idea what she was doing because she is only useful to the source

09:04.200 --> 09:11.240
writers at certain times. So then they write about her a lot and we know, well we hope

09:11.240 --> 09:20.160
we know, loads about five-year periods of her life where she seems to be really fascinating

09:20.160 --> 09:27.920
to the sources and then all of a sudden she's not for five-year periods. So she's a really

09:27.920 --> 09:32.880
interesting person when you're thinking about why people in the Roman world wrote down what

09:32.880 --> 09:40.840
they did and what kind of messages they were trying to portray and to send with their writing

09:40.840 --> 09:46.240
and to be able to see that they were not writing, regardless of how much Tacitus tries to say

09:46.240 --> 09:51.880
that he's writing, he's just writing objective facts and he claims that he's just writing

09:51.880 --> 09:57.620
the things that happened in a row. But when you look at how he shows Agrippina, you can

09:57.620 --> 10:03.760
see where he is picking and choosing what he wants to say happened in any given year

10:03.760 --> 10:09.800
and is making his decisions about how he wants to portray a particular year in Roman history,

10:09.800 --> 10:14.720
depending on whether he wants it to be a good year, in which case there's no Agrippina,

10:14.720 --> 10:17.440
or a bad year, in which case there's loads of Agrippina.

10:17.440 --> 10:24.640
Of course. Exactly. And I think this is a good moment where we can sort of segue into

10:24.640 --> 10:30.880
who Agrippina actually was. Because we're already talking about her, as if everyone

10:30.880 --> 10:38.920
knows who Agrippina is. Maybe before we sort of go into the details of why she actually

10:38.920 --> 10:44.520
is that well known and why she wants that special kind of person, maybe you could sort

10:44.520 --> 10:53.120
of give just a short description of who that woman is, who she was, and what makes her

10:53.120 --> 10:58.720
so special as compared to other famous Roman women, for example.

10:58.720 --> 11:06.640
Okay. So technically her name is Julia Agrippina, but she was known often as Agrippina the Younger

11:06.640 --> 11:12.360
in a way that the Romans love. Her mother was also called Agrippina, and her mother

11:12.360 --> 11:17.960
was also quite a prominent woman. She was the daughter of Agrippina the Elder and a

11:17.960 --> 11:26.440
guy called Germanicus, who were the kind of young, sexy prince and princess of Rome during

11:26.440 --> 11:34.220
the reign of Tiberius, who is the second Roman emperor. And Agrippina the Elder is the granddaughter

11:34.220 --> 11:42.240
of Augustus, the divine Augustus by this point. And pretty much all of her brothers

11:42.240 --> 11:47.160
and sisters have been killed or died under somewhat mysterious circumstances or have

11:47.160 --> 11:52.680
dropped dead of disease. So she is pretty much the last one standing by the time Tiberius

11:52.680 --> 12:03.960
comes to power. And so she is the last blood descendant of Augustus. And Germanicus is

12:03.960 --> 12:22.000
the son of Antonia Minor. So he is the grandson of Mark Antony and he is adopted by Tiberius

12:22.000 --> 12:27.840
and is like the second in line to the throne basically. But he is between them, they are

12:27.840 --> 12:34.800
immensely popular. They are just absolutely like the Beatles in Rome. People run out in

12:34.800 --> 12:39.200
the street and mob them wherever they go. They're just young and gorgeous and they have

12:39.200 --> 12:48.560
six children. And he's a great general. He has loads of victories in Germany, which is

12:48.560 --> 12:57.680
a big deal because under Augustus there was a great defeat in the German forests, which

12:57.680 --> 13:05.480
made the Romans hate the Germans forever. And made Augustus very sad. They lost three

13:05.480 --> 13:11.840
legions under a guy called Quictilius Varus, which is one of my favorite anecdotes about

13:11.840 --> 13:16.520
Augustus actually, which is that he was so sad that for three months he stopped shaving

13:16.520 --> 13:22.200
and cutting his hair and took up banging his head against walls shouting Quictilius Varus,

13:22.200 --> 13:31.840
give me back my legions. But those Germans were led by a defector who was a Roman and

13:31.840 --> 13:38.200
so they were a real problem. And finally, Germanicus beat them. So he got revenge on

13:38.200 --> 13:47.000
the German tribes. And so he is considered to be this great Roman hero as a result.

13:47.000 --> 13:53.720
And he has six children, three boys, three girls, of which Agrippina is the oldest girl,

13:53.720 --> 14:03.480
who was born while he was in Germany actually in what is now, I'm going to say it in German,

14:03.480 --> 14:12.520
right? Cologne. So he has the six children and then they all come back to Rome and then

14:12.520 --> 14:19.080
Germanicus mysteriously dies while on holiday in Syria. And everybody thinks he's been poisoned

14:19.080 --> 14:28.360
by Tiberius, caused a lot of problems. And I mean, first of all, through a solid decade,

14:28.360 --> 14:37.160
yeah? So a solid decade later, after Agrippina is brought up by her mother alone and alongside

14:37.160 --> 14:45.200
her brothers and sisters, her mother and older brothers, two oldest brothers are killed

14:45.200 --> 14:52.560
by Tiberius under circumstances that we don't know because that bit of Tacitus is missing.

14:52.560 --> 14:58.780
And the only brother left standing is Caligula, who a little bit after that becomes the emperor.

14:58.780 --> 15:03.360
And she gets to be the sister of the emperor, which is pretty good.

15:03.360 --> 15:09.400
I think you wrote in your book that we actually shouldn't call him Caligula because he had

15:09.400 --> 15:10.400
a name, right?

15:10.400 --> 15:13.240
He did have a name. His name was Gaius.

15:13.240 --> 15:18.360
It's sort of disrespect to call him by the name they called the little kid in the army

15:18.360 --> 15:19.360
camp.

15:19.360 --> 15:28.600
Yeah. Because Caligula is a diminutive version of Caliga, which is what the Roman army sandal

15:28.600 --> 15:35.160
is. So it's like calling him bootykins basically or little boots. And people would call him

15:35.160 --> 15:39.800
it after he became a bad emperor because they didn't like him. And so they would do it

15:39.800 --> 15:48.640
in order to mock him. And I have an absolutely irrational soft spot for a good-looking.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.720
There is absolutely no good reason for why I like him so much, but I'm really defensive

15:53.720 --> 16:02.600
of him and I always will try to defend him. So calling him Gaius just makes him sound

16:02.600 --> 16:08.480
like a person as well, I think. When you call him Caligula, he becomes this semi-fictional

16:08.480 --> 16:09.480
monster.

16:09.480 --> 16:17.520
I actually wrote my undergraduate dissertation on modern representations of Caligula. And

16:17.520 --> 16:23.720
there's so many, like he's in comic books, he's in all of these films, he's in all of

16:23.720 --> 16:32.880
these cartoons and things where Caligula is a fictional monster who's so evil that he's

16:32.880 --> 16:39.360
not even human. And I think that that makes when you say Caligula, people imagine something

16:39.360 --> 16:47.120
that is so ludicrous that they lose sight of the fact that he was a person. And so I

16:47.120 --> 16:49.720
tend to call him Gaius.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.640
Yeah, I understand that. And I think that that is actually something that I've noticed

16:53.640 --> 17:01.400
when I read your book, that you always try to convey that the people that we're reading

17:01.400 --> 17:08.360
about or the people that you're writing about, they're actual people. It's not just these

17:08.360 --> 17:15.480
templates or these ideas that we have when we think about Rome and about the people that

17:15.480 --> 17:21.560
live there, that they're actually people and a lot of the things they do, it's just what

17:21.560 --> 17:23.600
people do because they're people.

17:23.600 --> 17:29.400
Yeah, and people are inconsistent and do odd things that you can't explain. And you just

17:29.400 --> 17:35.920
need to look at any kind of politics and be like, I have no idea what this person is doing.

17:35.920 --> 17:39.720
Not to get too political, but just look at what's happening at the moment in this country.

17:39.720 --> 17:46.040
You're just like, what is happening here? None of this seems rational. People are odd and

17:46.040 --> 17:50.720
they were all doing things for their own weirdo reasons. And sometimes they just do things

17:50.720 --> 17:53.800
really rashly and sometimes they do things that go, oh, I don't even know why I did

17:53.800 --> 18:01.960
that. And I think there's quite a lot of history, particularly ones that try to tell big narratives,

18:01.960 --> 18:08.000
try to act like people are always very rational and are doing things for very rational reasons.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.560
And I don't think that that's particularly true. I think people are probably mostly just

18:12.560 --> 18:18.120
trying to get to the next day without fucking anything up too badly.

18:18.120 --> 18:23.720
That is especially true for Rome at that time, because I think you mentioned a couple of

18:23.720 --> 18:33.160
times that what a bad idea it is to give someone the power over an empire who's 17 years old,

18:33.160 --> 18:34.160
for example.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.160
Yeah, exactly.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.000
So why would you do that?

18:37.000 --> 18:42.440
It's ludicrous. And the only reason they do it is because he has the right blood, basically.

18:42.440 --> 18:53.200
Gaius is like 27 when he gets the empire, but he is basically a child because he has

18:53.200 --> 18:59.560
been hidden away on Capri and has never met anybody really. And then Nero is 17 when

18:59.560 --> 19:07.600
he becomes the emperor. I've met 17-year-olds. We don't let them vote.

19:07.600 --> 19:13.760
You probably wouldn't trust them with your car, so you certainly wouldn't trust them

19:13.760 --> 19:14.760
with an empire.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.840
Exactly. You trust them with an empire. And then all of a sudden they're expected to do

19:18.840 --> 19:23.000
loads of paperwork and know how to do all of the diplomacy that they need to do and

19:23.000 --> 19:29.120
do wars and do all of the other stuff. And unsurprisingly, Nero gives up on all of that

19:29.120 --> 19:34.920
immediately and just goes into singing.

19:34.920 --> 19:42.160
But let's just... I think we jumped a bit. And we don't have to do this in too much detail

19:42.160 --> 19:49.980
just so we can keep the timeline, right? Because currently she's the sister of Caligula, who's

19:49.980 --> 19:51.600
now the emperor, right?

19:51.600 --> 19:55.880
Yes. And he is very good to his sisters and he gives them loads of honours and he thinks

19:55.880 --> 20:04.760
they're brilliant. And in return they plot against him and plot to kill him with some

20:04.760 --> 20:11.600
troops in Germany, which he discovers very early on into the plot. And there's this great

20:11.600 --> 20:18.080
scene where he turns up at their holiday home in a place called Melvania and uncovers the

20:18.080 --> 20:24.320
plot. And presumably there's some kind of terrible showdown that ends with Gaius reading

20:24.320 --> 20:31.360
out Agrippina's love letters. And there's a trial and because he does like his sisters

20:31.360 --> 20:37.600
quite a lot, he doesn't execute them, he exiles them. So she gets exiled to quite a nice island

20:37.600 --> 20:46.080
actually called Pontia. And she spends a year in exile and during that year there is a more

20:46.080 --> 20:55.240
successful coup against him involving his uncle Claudius and the army. So Roman emperors

20:55.240 --> 20:59.960
have a kind of personal army in Rome, which is called the Praetorian Guard, who are very,

20:59.960 --> 21:06.240
very important because they answer only to the emperor, they don't answer to the senate.

21:06.240 --> 21:12.360
And they belong to the emperor and they are like a couple of thousand armed men who live

21:12.360 --> 21:17.080
in the city of Rome who live to protect the emperor. And so when they turn against the

21:17.080 --> 21:19.200
emperor, things tend to go quite badly.

21:19.200 --> 21:26.200
And it's happened quite a bit, hasn't it? I mean, not at this time when I think it was

21:26.200 --> 21:33.960
Gaius on the throne, but afterwards you had a couple of emperors that were sort of dethroned

21:33.960 --> 21:35.960
by the Praetorian Guard, right?

21:35.960 --> 21:42.320
Yeah, by the time you get to the third century, you get a lot. Every two years or so. And

21:42.320 --> 21:50.400
but they are, yeah, but this is kind of the first time that they overthrow an emperor

21:50.400 --> 21:57.240
and they install Claudius on the throne. Claudius is Germanicus's older brother, but he has

21:57.240 --> 22:02.840
been considered the embarrassing member of the family because he has some kind of physical

22:02.840 --> 22:09.880
disability and he is also very boring. So he has been kind of shuffled off and given

22:09.880 --> 22:15.360
up. He's never been shown in public really and he's been hidden away and he's been writing

22:15.360 --> 22:20.720
massive books about the history of the Etruscans and inventing new letters while everybody else

22:20.720 --> 22:25.920
has been doing politics and war. And then all of a sudden he becomes the emperor and

22:25.920 --> 22:35.000
very kindly he brings back Agrippina from exile and gives her a nice husband and tries

22:35.000 --> 22:40.200
to keep her happy but quiet. So she becomes, she goes from being a sister of the emperor

22:40.200 --> 22:48.520
to the exile to coming back and being a kind of upper class but not particularly prominent

22:48.520 --> 22:53.920
woman. So she is, she's reasonably, she has access to the emperor because he's her uncle,

22:53.920 --> 22:57.640
but she's not exactly like in a circle.

22:57.640 --> 23:02.000
And at this point she's, that's actually her second marriage, right?

23:02.000 --> 23:08.520
It is her second husband. She's married at 13 to a man in his 30s, obviously.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.520
Obviously.

23:09.520 --> 23:19.240
And then she had her one and only son who we remember as Nero but was born Lucius Domitius

23:19.240 --> 23:28.480
Henebarbus and she had him in the first year of Caligula's reign. So he is kind of about

23:28.480 --> 23:33.480
three or four by the time she gets back from exile. She is separated from him and her husband

23:33.480 --> 23:40.800
dies while she is in exile. So she gets back, she gets her kid back, she gets a mediocre

23:40.800 --> 23:50.920
husband and everything seems to be okay until the, Claudius's wife does something, and this

23:50.920 --> 23:57.160
is one of the reasons why I say that people are weird. She decides while Claudius is on

23:57.160 --> 24:04.960
a day trip to marry someone else in the middle of Rome.

24:04.960 --> 24:05.960
As you do.

24:05.960 --> 24:10.120
As you do. As the Empress of Rome in a city which is very public, you know, she has a

24:10.120 --> 24:16.280
wedding ceremony and marries a guy. And even the bit of Tacitus when he's describing it

24:16.280 --> 24:24.280
is just like, he just can't believe that it happened. He is just baffled by the fact

24:24.280 --> 24:31.320
that it happened and it is utterly baffling. And of course this ends up in her being executed

24:31.320 --> 24:39.120
because you can't have that kind of thing, which leaves Claudius, wife-less and something

24:39.120 --> 24:47.240
happens that is super weird and mysterious and there's no real good explanation for it

24:47.240 --> 24:57.080
and suddenly Claudius gets the law changed, the incest law changed and marries his niece,

24:57.080 --> 25:04.520
marries Agrippina. And there is a very ludicrous scene where somebody else suggests in the

25:04.520 --> 25:09.400
Senate that maybe they should change the incest law so that Claudius can marry his niece as

25:09.400 --> 25:14.840
if it was a big surprise present for Claudius.

25:14.840 --> 25:21.240
And he acted surprised because that was his job, right? To have someone deposit the idea

25:21.240 --> 25:26.280
and he's then going to act like everyone just wants him to marry his niece.

25:26.280 --> 25:32.200
Yeah, basically it's just a great mysterious surprise for him that everybody in Rome agrees

25:32.200 --> 25:38.600
it's a great idea for him to do this very convenient and beneficial marriage because

25:38.600 --> 25:49.720
he gets an almost adult heir because by the time this happens Nero is about 13, 14 years

25:49.720 --> 25:56.240
old so he gets one who, as far as the Roman aristocracy are concerned, that's an adult.

25:56.240 --> 26:02.660
He gets to marry Agrippina and she is enormously popular, everybody thinks she's great because

26:02.660 --> 26:09.920
of her dad mostly. She gets this reflected glory from her dad that Claudius never gets

26:09.920 --> 26:20.160
from being his brother. And so he gets her glory and prior to marrying her his reign

26:20.160 --> 26:24.040
has not been going well. There's been a couple of attempts to overthrow him, there's been

26:24.040 --> 26:35.100
a really big attempted coup with some troops trying to rise against him. He's executed

26:35.100 --> 26:39.680
quite a lot of people because that's really the only thing he knows how to do. It's going

26:39.680 --> 26:45.480
very badly indeed and so he kind of needs some good things, especially after the Messalina

26:45.480 --> 26:50.200
debacle where she marries someone else which just looks bad when your wife marries someone

26:50.200 --> 26:52.160
else while they're still married to you.

26:52.160 --> 26:53.800
It's not a good look really.

26:53.800 --> 26:59.000
It's not, it's embarrassing. No one wants to have to go out and tell their friends that

26:59.000 --> 27:04.800
that's what's happened to you. Is it embarrassing enough when you've got a break up anyway and

27:04.800 --> 27:08.840
you have to go and tell everybody that you break up without having to like, he's literally

27:08.840 --> 27:09.840
married someone else.

27:09.840 --> 27:16.480
Well it's so interesting because we talked earlier about how people make decisions and

27:16.480 --> 27:22.600
you don't know why they make them because they're so blatantly stupid for example. And

27:22.600 --> 27:30.280
I think when you talked about Messalina, his wife marrying this other guy, that you simply

27:30.280 --> 27:39.180
think that, because historians try to explain it, find an explanation for rather irrational

27:39.180 --> 27:45.840
behaviour and you said in the book that in your mind she probably just wasn't that smart.

27:45.840 --> 27:51.260
Yeah, no I don't think she was very smart, Lasse. I think that she just didn't really

27:51.260 --> 27:58.120
think it through more than the fact that she wanted to do it. And that, you know, it went

27:58.120 --> 28:01.680
badly for her. God knows what she thought was going to happen, but I think she just

28:01.680 --> 28:07.880
wasn't very clever. She was very young. She was 17 when she married Claudius and she was

28:07.880 --> 28:16.280
21 when she became suddenly the wife of the emperor and she's still in her mid-twenties

28:16.280 --> 28:23.800
when she dies and she's had two kids. She's young and an idiot.

28:23.800 --> 28:30.440
Probably. I mean that is sort of the misconception people have when they read about people from

28:30.440 --> 28:37.580
the past. They think everyone was a super villain, super intelligent or everything simply

28:37.580 --> 28:42.800
because people wrote about them, but there's idiots nowadays so why shouldn't there have

28:42.800 --> 28:44.680
been idiots back then?

28:44.680 --> 28:50.400
I'm pretty sure that Messalina was just kind of a bless her, just kind of an idiot who

28:50.400 --> 28:58.680
did idiotic things. I feel slightly defensive of her as well just because she was so young

28:58.680 --> 29:04.160
and I just think she didn't get much of a chance. And she also was probably not very

29:04.160 --> 29:09.400
smart. She just seems to have done everything a bit wrong.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.440
There's actually a couple of people in your book that did everything wrong.

29:14.440 --> 29:19.600
There are a few people who just seem to blunder from one bit to the other until eventually

29:19.600 --> 29:24.720
they fall on a sword.

29:24.720 --> 29:32.760
So Messalina, Claudius' wife, she gets executed.

29:32.760 --> 29:35.360
She does along with eight other men, yeah.

29:35.360 --> 29:42.760
Oh right, no, we've been there already. I sort of jumped back again. We're already

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
at Agrippina.

29:43.760 --> 29:51.400
We're already married, yeah. How Tacitus presents the fact that he marries his niece

29:51.400 --> 29:57.880
is that there is this kind of philosophical round table between Claudius and his closest

29:57.880 --> 30:06.640
advisors who are all ex-slaves. Each of the advisors has a candidate for marriage, so

30:06.640 --> 30:13.400
they're all trying to put forward their best candidate. One of whom is Claudius' first

30:13.400 --> 30:20.460
wife, one of whom is a woman called Lolia Paulina who is remembered because she is just

30:20.460 --> 30:29.240
very pretty. She married Caligula briefly, but he divorced her because it turns out she

30:29.240 --> 30:33.400
didn't have anything more really than being very pretty.

30:33.400 --> 30:41.000
So they offer up all these other women and then one of them offers up Agrippina and says

30:41.000 --> 30:49.080
basically we know that she's fertile, she's got a good bloodline, we know that you get

30:49.080 --> 30:54.040
on, she will be good for the dynasty, she'll be good for your popularity and if you're

30:54.040 --> 31:02.020
lucky she might have babies, which is super gross. Basically the argument that they make

31:02.020 --> 31:09.180
is that if the most honorable marriage you can make is with a member of the imperial

31:09.180 --> 31:15.160
family then the emperor should only marry a member of the imperial family because he

31:15.160 --> 31:21.200
should only marry the most honorable woman. So that's their brilliant argument. Obviously

31:21.200 --> 31:30.000
it's a set piece that he writes that this happened. Maybe it is indicative of palace

31:30.000 --> 31:40.680
workings, palace machinations, but that's his theory. But that makes Agrippina a passive

31:40.680 --> 31:47.620
object in that she had nothing to do with it. Suetonius, who is a biographer, says

31:47.620 --> 31:58.200
that she seduced him by sitting on his lap and kissing his cheek, which is a way of making

31:58.200 --> 32:04.320
her basically into a whore and making Claudius into somebody who's too dumb to do anything.

32:04.320 --> 32:09.400
As soon as there's a woman in front of him he just has to marry her regardless of what's

32:09.400 --> 32:14.760
going on. Possibly it was somewhere in the middle, possibly it was something completely

32:14.760 --> 32:19.560
different, possibly he decided that he wanted to marry her and she as a woman had no legal

32:19.560 --> 32:24.720
power and had no ability to say no, which I think is something that is often forgotten

32:24.720 --> 32:31.720
when we're talking about this stuff. If she didn't want to marry her uncle, she had absolutely

32:31.720 --> 32:41.560
no ability to say no. It would have been marry him or probably die. But yeah, they got married

32:41.560 --> 32:49.880
on New Year's Day and then she was married to her 50-year-old uncle, her third husband.

32:49.880 --> 32:58.400
And then Tacitus writes about this as if an earthquake hit Rome that day and everything

32:58.400 --> 33:07.480
afterwards picking up after the earthquake because he thinks that she immediately becomes

33:07.480 --> 33:11.880
powerful and Tacitus hates that.

33:11.880 --> 33:17.480
It shouldn't happen in Rome, right? To have a powerful woman like that?

33:17.480 --> 33:22.480
It absolutely should not happen in Rome. Everything is set up specifically to prevent that. But

33:22.480 --> 33:27.200
also everything in their system was very carefully set up after they threw the kings

33:27.200 --> 33:34.020
out to prevent one person from having lots of power. And they've now got a monarchy.

33:34.020 --> 33:37.520
Things go wrong every so often.

33:37.520 --> 33:45.400
It's interesting that Agrippina already, back when she was just Caligula's sister or Guy's

33:45.400 --> 33:51.080
sister, she already had more, not more power, but she had more freedom than a woman usually

33:51.080 --> 33:56.680
had because he invested her with the vestal virgin privileges, right?

33:56.680 --> 33:58.360
Yes, he did.

33:58.360 --> 34:05.880
So she was kind of used to not having to live strictly in that system.

34:05.880 --> 34:14.400
She was released from a lot of the legal constraints that were put on women. And she was also given

34:14.400 --> 34:25.320
a lot of power. Romans had lictors, which were people who would walk beside men who

34:25.320 --> 34:33.080
were in the Roman government. So if you were a Roman magistrate, you had an official job,

34:33.080 --> 34:37.760
then you got a lictor or two lictors, if you were very important, who would walk in front

34:37.760 --> 34:43.540
of you and they would carry the facies, so the bundle of sticks with an axe in it, which

34:43.540 --> 34:52.440
represented the power of the state and the ability of the state to kill you. Which really

34:52.440 --> 34:59.000
get the word fascism. And so the more you had, the better you were. By the time you

34:59.000 --> 35:04.420
get to them having emperors, an emperor would have about 12, so it was a procession of lictors

35:04.420 --> 35:11.080
walking down the street. And so she was given a lictor, under Gaius, and she was given the

35:11.080 --> 35:17.180
ability to ride in a special cart and got the best seats at the games and things like

35:17.180 --> 35:22.960
that. And also the ability to sign contracts without having a man do it for you, which

35:22.960 --> 35:26.920
is probably even more important.

35:26.920 --> 35:36.200
One thing I'm not quite clear about, because when she was just a guy's sister, she had

35:36.200 --> 35:41.400
these privileges, right? Then she was exiled and when she came back, did she still have

35:41.400 --> 35:43.400
those privileges or were they gone?

35:43.400 --> 35:50.160
No, they would have been gone. So all of that was kind of stripped from her. And she got

35:50.160 --> 36:00.240
them back when she became Agrippina Augusta. So in the first year of Claudius's reign,

36:00.240 --> 36:09.360
first year of her marriage to Claudius, she got given the title of Augusta, which is the

36:09.360 --> 36:16.400
feminine version of Augustus, which by that time had become basically the title of emperor.

36:16.400 --> 36:24.440
So when you became emperor, you took the name Augustus. And she is the first young woman

36:24.440 --> 36:32.560
to and the first woman is still involved in public life to take that title. And then

36:32.560 --> 36:39.600
she gets all of that stuff back. And that's the point at which she becomes really special

36:39.600 --> 36:42.400
and really important in the Roman world.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.520
And she effectively becomes the empress of Rome.

36:46.520 --> 36:53.480
Yeah, that's the point where she becomes the first kind of proper empress. So there are

36:53.480 --> 36:59.240
two women before her who get given that title. One of them is Livia, Augustus's wife, but

36:59.240 --> 37:09.160
after he dies when she is quite elderly and she is basically still confined to a domestic

37:09.160 --> 37:16.360
space by Tiberius. And the other is Antonia Minor when she is very old indeed and practically

37:16.360 --> 37:23.040
bedridden. She doesn't get to exercise it very much. Whereas Agrippina is in her thirties

37:23.040 --> 37:33.360
and she is granted this title and she immediately becomes the emperor's partner. And that is

37:33.360 --> 37:41.680
the first time that a woman has become a partner in rule. Every previous woman has kind of

37:41.680 --> 37:50.160
confined themselves for better or for worse to the proper domestic sphere of womanly influence.

37:50.160 --> 38:00.160
And Agrippina shows up receiving diplomatic missions and appearing sitting on a throne

38:00.160 --> 38:10.080
next to Claudius and becomes a part of his advisory council and absolutely scandalises

38:10.080 --> 38:15.360
everybody as a result because a woman has never done that before. And a woman is not

38:15.360 --> 38:22.400
supposed to do that and the Romans literally think that women are incapable of doing that.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.920
So they don't like it one bit.

38:25.920 --> 38:31.660
Well, they've never actually had someone do it so they wouldn't even know if they could

38:31.660 --> 38:37.720
do it. But they just assume it's impossible because obviously they're not men.

38:37.720 --> 38:46.680
As far as they're concerned, every woman who ever has any kind of power immediately shows

38:46.680 --> 38:55.240
her kind of feminine nature and becomes cruel and despotic and tyrannical. And if you asked

38:55.240 --> 39:01.480
a Roman they would give you infinite examples of this happening. And most of them would

39:01.480 --> 39:09.240
be women ruling households full of slaves, but they consider that to be the proper place

39:09.240 --> 39:12.600
for women. And even then they think they can't do it particularly well.

39:12.600 --> 39:17.920
And I think that you mentioned in the book as well that what Agrippina does is she sort

39:17.920 --> 39:29.920
of tries to be masculine in her demeanour. So she doesn't flaunt her femininity, but

39:29.920 --> 39:37.880
rather sort of tries to mimic the way that men would behave. Which of course then they

39:37.880 --> 39:41.640
kind of said that's not right either.

39:41.640 --> 39:50.640
Yeah, it's a lose-lose situation because if she had dressed in pretty dresses and worn

39:50.640 --> 39:56.040
lots of jewels and been feminine, then she would have been criticised for spending too

39:56.040 --> 40:02.640
much money on jewels and being feminine and luxurious. But because she is quite austere

40:02.640 --> 40:11.040
and she's notorious for being anti-luxurious, she doesn't wear lots of jewels, she doesn't

40:11.040 --> 40:17.240
wear big embroidered tunics, she wears fairly basic clothing and she has no real interest

40:17.240 --> 40:25.100
in big dinner parties and luxury and spending lots of money. And she doesn't decorate herself

40:25.100 --> 40:31.880
like women are supposed to decorate themselves. Therefore she is considered to be freakishly

40:31.880 --> 40:39.960
masculine and kind of disgusting that way instead. So she is a bad woman if she does

40:39.960 --> 40:44.360
womanly things and she's a bad woman if she does masculine things. So she couldn't win

40:44.360 --> 40:50.600
whatever she did, so she just does her thing. At one point she does try to mix the two together

40:50.600 --> 40:57.960
and she turns up in a very spectacular event wearing a masculine Greek military cloak made

40:57.960 --> 41:04.660
of gold thread in order to really annoy everybody by wearing man's clothing but man's clothing

41:04.660 --> 41:13.560
made of gold. But that's because she's kind of great and I love that kind of the fact

41:13.560 --> 41:19.200
that she would occasionally, she just has no fear at all and I find that amazing. She

41:19.200 --> 41:26.000
does things that no other woman I think would try to do, no other person would really try

41:26.000 --> 41:30.360
to do because they know how much opprobrium they would get for it. And the first time

41:30.360 --> 41:39.480
that she appears beside Claudius, she's receiving a British prisoner who has been causing problems

41:39.480 --> 41:43.640
in Britain for a long time called Caratacus and they finally capture him and bring him

41:43.640 --> 41:50.720
to Rome and he is paraded through the streets and then brought to Claudius. And sitting

41:50.720 --> 41:58.220
in next to Claudius on her own throne in front of the kind of big standards and the flags

41:58.220 --> 42:06.280
of Rome and the army is Agrippina and it's just such a shocking thing for them to see

42:06.280 --> 42:15.880
and it's such a really powerful moment and it must have been kind of quite a shock for

42:15.880 --> 42:20.140
the people as she kind of came out and sat down. It must have been quite the ripple of

42:20.140 --> 42:26.060
excitement going through the crowd and it really is something that people talked about

42:26.060 --> 42:31.500
for a long time afterwards because she was really putting herself in a public space and

42:31.500 --> 42:37.500
sitting next to her husband and saying, I am the Augusta, he is the Augustus, we come

42:37.500 --> 42:38.500
as a team.

42:38.500 --> 42:46.820
And I mean that was probably sort of the outward way of showing what had been happening sort

42:46.820 --> 42:53.040
of inside the palace as well when the clients came to talk to the emperor and then there

42:53.040 --> 42:58.160
was suddenly the empress as well and basically doing the emperor's job.

42:58.160 --> 43:04.060
Yeah, sitting next to him, hearing out, doing the deals that you do and the day, like most

43:04.060 --> 43:12.460
of an elite Roman person's day is taken up with the round of meetings that you have in

43:12.460 --> 43:17.020
the morning with your clients and patrons. And when you're the emperor you just have

43:17.020 --> 43:23.700
a lot of clients who rely on you for their careers and who come and see you every morning

43:23.700 --> 43:29.260
and you have to talk to them all every single day. And it's a really big ritual part of

43:29.260 --> 43:35.820
the Roman day and she would all of a sudden have been there receiving all of Claudius'

43:35.820 --> 43:43.500
clients as her own being. And then they would go off and discuss matters of the empire with

43:43.500 --> 43:51.020
his advisors who were all men and the head of the Praetorian Guard and all of the other

43:51.020 --> 43:57.300
politicians and consuls and senators who were close to Claudius would be there and then

43:57.300 --> 44:05.580
there would be this woman in the middle of it for the first time in history. Just being

44:05.580 --> 44:14.260
the first person to ever do that and causing absolute shock because it was just beyond

44:14.260 --> 44:18.300
anything that they could really imagine that a woman would try to do this.

44:18.300 --> 44:47.820
So what would you say, what is the reason why it works for Agrippina? I mean what were

44:47.820 --> 44:55.580
the things that she did or was it the fact that Claudius was kind of feeble or weak?

44:55.580 --> 45:01.460
It is the fact that Claudius let her, yeah. It is a monarchy in the end. Roman monarchy

45:01.460 --> 45:09.140
is a very strange monarchy in that it is balanced on two legs, the army and the senate, both

45:09.140 --> 45:16.320
of whom have to be kept happy all the time. But it is still a monarchy and Claudius is

45:16.320 --> 45:23.620
still the only person who gets a say in what happens day to day. As long as Claudius lets

45:23.620 --> 45:28.460
her be there and Claudius doesn't say anything, no one is going to say, what the hell is she

45:28.460 --> 45:33.300
doing here because Claudius can have them executed at any minute.

45:33.300 --> 45:37.180
Sure. I mean it's not unheard of.

45:37.180 --> 45:44.180
Yeah and he quite likes doing that, they're all quite afraid of him. And also it helps

45:44.180 --> 45:50.540
that she's really good at keeping people happy. When you burrow down into what was

45:50.540 --> 45:59.260
happening after she came into power alongside Claudius, you see that she very carefully

45:59.260 --> 46:07.060
balances giving everybody something so that nobody is unhappy at any time. So when she

46:07.060 --> 46:16.700
needs to make changes, everybody gets something and nobody gets nothing. So there is no reason

46:16.700 --> 46:22.340
for people to resent her. She doesn't destroy people's careers, she might shift their career

46:22.340 --> 46:29.660
around a little bit, but she doesn't have them thrown in the Tiber or exiled, which

46:29.660 --> 46:36.180
she could have done but doesn't. And so she is very good at making friends. And when you

46:36.180 --> 46:43.060
look at things like how many people are executed or exiled during Claudius's reign, you see

46:43.060 --> 46:49.940
that almost all of them happen before Agrippina comes into power. And there are no attempts

46:49.940 --> 47:01.700
against Claudius's life that don't come from Agrippina. After she becomes Empress, the

47:01.700 --> 47:13.300
coups and attempted assassinations just drop off. And she is involved clearly in arranging

47:13.300 --> 47:17.700
some quite difficult situations. So there's a big situation in Jerusalem, which could

47:17.700 --> 47:25.460
be really difficult that because she is involved in it ends up being managed without kicking

47:25.460 --> 47:33.220
off into a war, which it does a few years later under Nero. And she's just really good

47:33.220 --> 47:41.460
at diplomacy. And obviously Tacitus describes all of these as really terrible things because

47:41.460 --> 47:46.940
she's involved in them. But when you take a step back from how he's describing it and

47:46.940 --> 47:53.860
look at what he's describing, you see that she's doing really good work. And so people

47:53.860 --> 47:58.060
have, apart from the fact that she's a woman, people don't have too much of a reason to

47:58.060 --> 47:59.060
hate her.

47:59.060 --> 48:05.620
And I mean, that's interesting that you said that Tacitus is the one who's describing how

48:05.620 --> 48:11.900
terrible it is that she has that sort of power, but doesn't even realize that he's describing

48:11.900 --> 48:20.620
a stabilizing force in the whole empire and responsible for the fact that Claudius wasn't

48:20.620 --> 48:23.100
killed even earlier than he was.

48:23.100 --> 48:27.540
I don't think he necessarily thinks it's a good thing that Claudius wasn't killed earlier.

48:27.540 --> 48:34.180
He's not a mad fan of Claudius. If he had his way, then the entire Julio-Claudian family

48:34.180 --> 48:37.460
would have been thrown in a volcano very early.

48:37.460 --> 48:43.740
Just in the sense that as a spectator or an observer, you don't root for anyone to be

48:43.740 --> 48:45.220
killed generally.

48:45.220 --> 48:54.380
And that is what he describes. He thinks he's describing the absolute degradation of Rome.

48:54.380 --> 49:00.580
The worst that it gets is under Agrippina and then Agrippina is responsible for Nero.

49:00.580 --> 49:13.340
And Nero is universally considered to be bad. He has zero friends in Rome ever. So Agrippina

49:13.340 --> 49:22.460
is the very bottom of how bad it can get in Rome as far as Tartusitus is concerned.

49:22.460 --> 49:28.820
But what he is describing is a pretty stable, very good, strong reign where she does lots

49:28.820 --> 49:34.860
of good things, where she's founding colonies, where she is keeping the edge of the empire

49:34.860 --> 49:41.460
happy. She keeps the center of Rome happy. There's no real disasters or famines or anything

49:41.460 --> 49:46.820
during her reign. And he describes a really good five-year period of rule.

49:46.820 --> 49:53.520
Speaking of founding colonies for the benefit of our German listeners, you mentioned it

49:53.520 --> 49:58.860
before where she was born, which is interesting because it's basically, the name you said

49:58.860 --> 50:05.100
is the name derived from the colony that she founded. So could you maybe just say a few

50:05.100 --> 50:06.100
things about that?

50:06.100 --> 50:18.820
So yeah, so she was born on the edge of the Rhine in what was a Roman camp. It was originally

50:18.820 --> 50:25.020
the home of a people called the Ubi and then the Romans were friends with them. So it became

50:25.020 --> 50:31.500
a Roman camp and she was born there. It was a base for when Germanicus was moving into

50:31.500 --> 50:40.740
Germany. And then when she became Empress, she decided to found a city there, found

50:40.740 --> 50:47.500
a colony and a Roman colony is where they would settle Roman soldiers. So everybody

50:47.500 --> 50:52.380
there became a Roman citizen and then the person who founded it would become a kind

50:52.380 --> 50:56.740
of patron of the city and they would look after it and it would get lots of investment.

50:56.740 --> 51:09.300
And it was called Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium, which gradually got, it became a very big

51:09.300 --> 51:17.980
center of Roman activity there. It became a really big center for glass manufacture,

51:17.980 --> 51:24.900
really big place where a lot of artisanal glass came from and a lot of the glass that

51:24.900 --> 51:32.540
was used by the Roman Empire. It became a really big space for Roman culture in that

51:32.540 --> 51:38.700
part of the world and gradually that name got shortened to Colonia, just the colony

51:38.700 --> 51:45.300
and gradually that became Coln, what we call Cologne in English. But it is her space.

51:45.300 --> 51:52.060
And a couple of years ago in 2015, which is the 2000 years from Agrippina's birth, they

51:52.060 --> 52:01.180
did have a big celebration of her in the museum there. She's better known in Cologne

52:01.180 --> 52:07.580
than she is probably anywhere else in the world because they have a big parade every

52:07.580 --> 52:14.300
year and they have the mother of Cologne, Agrippina, is like this character that gets

52:14.300 --> 52:26.520
to be in it and she's kind of pantomime tart. But it's something. So she's the founder

52:26.520 --> 52:31.340
of the city and she does that much better than Claudius ever managed to do because she

52:31.340 --> 52:36.700
doesn't kick anybody out. Whereas Claudius founds a couple of places in Britain, but

52:36.700 --> 52:41.020
every time he does it, he removes everybody who's there and then gives all of their land

52:41.020 --> 52:47.620
to some Roman soldiers. And then you end up with things like the revolt of Boudicca,

52:47.620 --> 52:54.460
which happens quite just before this really. And then Agrippina does it very successfully

52:54.460 --> 52:58.580
and it becomes a massive centre of activity. She does everything well.

52:58.580 --> 53:04.820
So the people of Cologne are basically the ones that should be thankful to Agrippina

53:04.820 --> 53:10.180
for the fact that they're cultured like that because they were, you know, that their city

53:10.180 --> 53:14.460
was born out of Roman culture and class making and all that.

53:14.460 --> 53:20.780
Absolutely. They wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Agrippina. I mean, somebody else might

53:20.780 --> 53:26.460
have founded a city there, but it exists as it exists because of her. And I went there

53:26.460 --> 53:34.060
actually. I made my partner go on a holiday there and it's a lovely city. Great cathedral,

53:34.060 --> 53:37.620
lovely museum, highly recommended for a visit.

53:37.620 --> 53:42.460
And I think they have quite good beer as well. They do have very good beer and they do that

53:42.460 --> 53:45.380
little, that thing, which I think they only really do there, where they give you like

53:45.380 --> 53:48.980
a quarter pint and then they just keep coming round and giving you new ones and before you

53:48.980 --> 53:52.820
know it, you've drunk about five and you can't stand up.

53:52.820 --> 54:00.140
That's convenient. It is. But it tastes very nice.

54:00.140 --> 54:09.380
Right. So, generally she was a very good influence on the empire basically or on Claudius and

54:09.380 --> 54:14.700
then the empire. And then things go south?

54:14.700 --> 54:24.020
Things go a bit south, yes, when she kills Claudius, which is a real problem.

54:24.020 --> 54:25.020
Things go a bit south.

54:25.020 --> 54:30.860
They do go a bit south. There's a whole debate and I have a debate with myself back and forth

54:30.860 --> 54:36.300
constantly as to whether she did kill Claudius. And in the end I came to the conclusion that

54:36.300 --> 54:45.460
every single source says that she did, including the very tiny number of contemporary sources.

54:45.460 --> 54:54.380
People that lived and worked alongside Agrippina said that that is what happened. So, quite

54:54.380 --> 55:00.820
possibly I think I have to lean into the fact that she probably did actually kill him.

55:00.820 --> 55:06.700
And quite possibly it's because the thing that is the most important to her is getting

55:06.700 --> 55:16.220
Nero to be emperor. That is the kind of defining goal of her life really, which is not so much

55:16.220 --> 55:22.900
because she doesn't want to rule by herself and she never really tries to rule by herself.

55:22.900 --> 55:33.220
She wants Nero to be emperor. But Claudius had a biological son of his own and for a

55:33.220 --> 55:40.700
long time it was fine because Nero was six years older than Britannicus and his mother

55:40.700 --> 55:49.760
was around. He was given proper jobs as a judge and things when he was about 14 years

55:49.760 --> 55:56.100
old, which is very silly. He was made prefect of the city of Rome. I just keep thinking

55:56.100 --> 55:59.740
of all these people who had to deal with him on an official basis and just looking at this

55:59.740 --> 56:06.220
spotty teenager. And he's supposed to be making important judgments about crimes going on

56:06.220 --> 56:17.620
in the city. But as Britannicus grows up and starts to hit adulthood himself or adulthood

56:17.620 --> 56:23.440
in the Roman census, that's kind of up to 13, 14 years old, he becomes a threat basically

56:23.440 --> 56:30.500
and it's possible that Nero won't become emperor. Possibly Claudius will want his son

56:30.500 --> 56:36.740
to take on maybe a joint emperor role or he will want him to be emperor instead of Nero.

56:36.740 --> 56:43.140
And so as that starts to happen, Claudius mysteriously dies after eating a mushroom

56:43.140 --> 56:50.020
that may or may not have been poisoned by Agrippina and a woman called La Custa, who

56:50.020 --> 56:59.460
is a notorious and very famous poisoner. And then I think that Agrippina expects everything

56:59.460 --> 57:05.500
will be all uphill from there because she manages, she kind of arranges it all very

57:05.500 --> 57:12.080
carefully so that Nero, who is 17, comes out and is hailed as emperor immediately. She

57:12.080 --> 57:19.580
has been in charge of his education. She has given him these two tutors called Seneca

57:19.580 --> 57:26.660
and Burrus. Burrus is the head of the Praetorian Guard and he is like the head of the army.

57:26.660 --> 57:33.660
So he's on side Seneca is this famous philosopher who I irrationally hate.

57:33.660 --> 57:39.460
Well, he's not a very grateful person, is he?

57:39.460 --> 57:44.660
I mean, he's not a very grateful person. He's been brought back from exile twice,

57:44.660 --> 57:49.340
I think, by Agrippina. And he's still being a shit to her.

57:49.340 --> 57:53.340
He's a real shit to her and he's given the job as being the advisor to the emperor and

57:53.340 --> 57:59.220
he's kind of given everything by her. And he is kind of notorious. It's kind of a joke

57:59.220 --> 58:05.420
that he is this famous stoic philosopher who failed to live up to any of his stoic principles.

58:05.420 --> 58:12.880
He writes loads and loads about mercy and about being austere and about not reacting

58:12.880 --> 58:18.740
badly to things. And yet he, this dio for some reason, really hates him, which I find

58:18.740 --> 58:24.640
really funny. And he writes all these passages about how he owned 150 tables. He writes about

58:24.640 --> 58:30.380
being modest and austere, but owns all of these tables and spends all of this money

58:30.380 --> 58:37.180
on himself while chastising everybody else for spending too much money. So he'll complain

58:37.180 --> 58:41.780
about other people's luxury while living in a luxurious palace of his own. And the only

58:41.780 --> 58:45.580
time he ever manages to live up to his own ideals is as soon as it comes to the idea

58:45.580 --> 58:52.900
of a woman in power, at which point he undermines his patron Agrippina at every turn. As soon

58:52.900 --> 59:03.260
as Nero becomes emperor, Seneca writes this speech for Nero in which he says that the

59:03.260 --> 59:06.380
first thing that's going to change in the Roman emperor is that there's going to be

59:06.380 --> 59:13.220
no more interference from the imperial household in politics. So there'll be no more freedmen

59:13.220 --> 59:20.300
and slaves and women involved in politics basically, which is a direct blow and saying

59:20.300 --> 59:32.000
no more girls. And then there is this moment that happens, which is this great turning

59:32.000 --> 59:41.300
point in Agrippina's career where in the first year of Nero's reign, he is receiving

59:41.300 --> 59:46.860
a delegation of people from Armenia, who are kind of this buffer zone between the Roman

59:46.860 --> 59:52.820
Empire and the Parthian Empire. And both sides always want to control it because they want

59:52.820 --> 59:58.940
this buffer zone against the others. So Armenians are always turning up. And there looks like

59:58.940 --> 01:00:04.280
there might be a war against Parthia in Armenia and everybody's very on edge and everybody's

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:10.860
very concerned that it's going to be a child led by a woman leading this war. And the

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:16.520
delegation comes and they're all prepared and Nero comes in and sits down and then Agrippina

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:25.420
comes in and goes to step up onto the dais to take her seat. And Seneca whispers in Nero's

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:30.980
ear and Nero has this kind of split second decision as to whether he is going to let

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:37.500
his mother sit down and receive this delegation with him or whether he is going to prevent

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:43.060
her from being there and whether he's going to be a partner with his mother and let her

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.540
continue her role or whether he's going to side with what Seneca is telling him to do

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:54.060
and remove her. And he chooses Seneca and he stands up and greets his mother and gives

01:00:54.060 --> 01:01:01.140
her a hug and then carefully leads her away and takes her out of the room. And basically

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:08.100
says to her with that action, you are no longer a partner in this ruling this empire. You

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.980
are my mother and you will be in a motherly role and I am the emperor and this is man's

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:18.700
business. And then in order to make it up for her in the final kind of spit in the eye,

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:27.940
he buys her a pretty dress and basically says to her, now you are ornamental, your role

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:34.820
is ornamental to be domestic and pretty and stand over there and I will do, me and Seneca

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:41.980
over here will do the business, which she kind of takes as you would quite badly.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:47.740
Either he doesn't know his mother or he really wants to piss her off.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:54.060
Or he knows exactly how to hurt her. It is like either that dress when he buys her the

01:01:54.060 --> 01:02:02.340
dress I just think either he is like a rubbish husband who just brings home flowers from

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:07.940
the corner shop to say sorry for something and just doesn't even think or try. He just

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.460
thinks what do women like pretty things, I'll just give her that. And he just doesn't know.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:22.400
Or it is an insult. It's just such a deliberate insult to her. And the fact that their relationship

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:29.900
goes downhill quite quickly and she is later evicted from the imperial house. So she is

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:38.220
sent to live in another house and she is banned from receiving male visitors. So people aren't

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:46.860
allowed to go and talk to her anymore and she is kind of ostracised within Rome. And

01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:52.940
then there is a moment where she comes very, very close to being either exiled or executed

01:02:52.940 --> 01:03:00.500
because her ex-sister-in-law kind of drums up this very weird conspiracy while Nero

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:08.780
is drunk and nearly gets him to execute Agrippina in the middle of the night for allegedly conspiring

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:15.180
against him. But is stopped by Burrus actually who is pretty loyal to Agrippina all the way

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:21.980
through to be fair to him. And there is this great moment where Burrus basically says look

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:27.300
you're drunk, calm down, we'll sort it out in the morning, go and sleep it off and we'll

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.260
talk to your mum in the morning and we'll see what happens and we'll just let her have

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:36.000
her say. So Nero goes and sleeps it off and the next morning Burrus goes and sees Agrippina

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.620
and tells her what's going on. And she demands a meeting with her son and there's this kind

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:47.680
of behind closed doors chat which no one knows what happens. But by the time she goes in

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:52.740
on the verge, the last thing he said is that he wants her dead and by the time she comes

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:59.660
out she is back in the palace. Some of her friends have got new jobs, like one of her

01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:04.740
best friends suddenly becomes the prefect of Egypt and the people who accused her are

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:12.580
all exiled. So she has talked her way out of being executed and back into his good books

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580
which is brilliant.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.940
Well she was probably like listen you little shit.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:26.580
Yeah, look what the fuck do you think you're doing? Yeah and at that point, Tacitus has

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:32.700
nothing more to say about her for five years. She vanishes, just completely vanishes.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:39.540
So she vanishes from the source, from the source material, but she doesn't vanish from

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.540
Rome.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:48.940
No, she's still in Rome. She's still pretty, like all of this is speculation because there's

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:52.220
nothing written down as to what she's doing, nothing stated as to what she's doing, but

01:04:52.220 --> 01:05:03.900
she is almost certainly around and still involved in politics and doing kind of behind the scenes

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.960
political things. So she is no longer doing spectacular things like appearing in a big

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:15.460
cloak made of gold in front of massive audiences or receiving delegations and things which

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:24.260
make people talk. She is doing more behind the scenes things and involved in Nero's

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.320
reign and the reason that I'm pretty confident in saying that is one, the first five years

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:34.840
of Nero's reign are pretty good. He doesn't do anything too terrible or fuck anything

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:44.940
up too badly despite being effectively incompetent and two, because after that five years he

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:51.820
decides to kill her and if she is happily sitting in a villa somewhere outside of Rome

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:58.540
or chilling somewhere not involved in politics and not doing anything at all, then there

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:05.000
is no reason for him to kill her. The general reason which is given for his decision is

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:13.340
that she is constantly trying to be involved in his life and that he wants to marry a woman

01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:21.660
called Poppaea but he already has a wife called Octavia who is also his step-sister obviously.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:28.100
So he has this wife who is a very quiet, seemingly quite nice girl who Agrippina is great friends

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:36.580
with and there is no situation where Agrippina will let him divorce Octavia. Octavia is really

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:43.820
popular, she is a great wife of the emperor, she never does anything to cause trouble,

01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.980
she is just good at getting on with stuff, she is like a proper good little Kate Middleton

01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:56.220
kind of girl, she is just really well behaved and there is no way that Agrippina is going

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:04.460
to let him divorce her without breaking his knees and it would just end badly. But he

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:09.860
really really really wants to marry Poppaea and he really dislikes Octavia and the best

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:15.580
thing that he can think of as a way to deal with this because he is the emperor and he

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:26.140
can is to just kill his mother. And if she is not a big enough force that in Rome and

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:34.140
in Roman politics that he can't get away with doing stuff as the emperor without killing

01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.460
her, that's the only way that he can get around it, then that suggests that she is still really

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:44.820
important. The other thing of course is that he initially tries to get Burris to just stab

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.980
her because that's the easiest way to kill somebody in Rome when you are the emperor,

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:53.860
just be like can you go and stab her please. Burris says that no soldier will kill her

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:59.100
because they like her too much, that no soldier is ever going to kill the daughter of Germanicus.

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:05.460
So she still has this immense popularity and it's just not going to happen so he has to

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:10.180
come up with some bizarre series of events to try and kill her without making it look

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.180
like he killed her.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:18.420
Do you want to go into the detail of the foil plot in the boat?

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:28.020
Yeah, there's a few different plots which get put together in different sources. So

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.220
there's one plot which involves him poisoning her which seems very sensible but it turns

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:39.580
out that she takes antidotes so poisons don't work so she is taking antidotes. And then

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.180
there is a bizarre plot which Suetonius says which makes little to no sense which is that

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:52.740
he's going to rig the ceiling of her bedroom so that it collapses on her while she's sleeping

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:59.100
and that gets foiled because nobody in her household will turn against her. She has a

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:03.340
loyal household so nobody will let the workmen in.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:08.020
Yeah, gotta install new air conditioning.

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:20.780
Exactly. So this guy who is in charge of the navy has seen some kind of games with

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:27.540
a trick boat and he thinks this is a great idea so he comes to Nero and says look there's

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:32.780
this trick boat that we can use and it's really unclear how it works but it either

01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:42.540
kind of collapses or opens in some way or kind of dips or something and the people

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:47.380
on one side are thrown off and then it kind of goes back together again so it's a kind

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:55.180
of show boat of some kind that makes little sense. And Nero because he's very theatrical

01:09:55.180 --> 01:10:17.660
as a man thinks that's a great idea so he gets Agrippina to come and visit him for a festival and they have a nice dinner and then he gets Agrippina to this dinner and they go have a nice dinner and then he takes her down to the dock and puts her on this boat and this kind of shows the ludicrous

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:43.580
richness of the imperial throne which is that they get boats from each other's houses that's so far apart that they just get a boat from each other's house back home again. Puts her on this boat and Tastis has this very nice picture that he paints of this calm night and her lazing on this boat and them kind of floating under the stars and then all of a sudden the boat collapses.

01:10:43.580 --> 01:11:00.860
She is tossed into the water but in the demonstration of how poorly Nero knows his mother he doesn't know that she's a very strong swimmer and is able to without much problem and with an injured arm swim happily to the shore.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:30.060
Her maidservant, her slave gets off slightly less well by shouting help me help me I'm Agrippina and gets beaten to death with an oar. But Agrippina is smarter than that. She gets happily over to the sun, she walks back to her house and she sends a messenger to Nero's house to say

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:54.060
Wouldn't you know, there's been an accident. What a mysterious thing that has happened. And then she waits for the response because I think she can't believe that it has really been a plot against her. She hopes that it has been an accident because she just sits and waits.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:20.060
And what Nero sends back is a man, well he sends back troops. He sends a whole lot of troops with knives and he sets up this weird thing where he throws a dagger at the feet of the messenger that Agrippina sent and says oh my goodness Agrippina sent someone to kill me, better send someone off to kill her.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:46.060
And these troops come in and drag out her slaves and stab her to death in her bedroom. And her last words according to Tacitus are telling them really to stab her in her womb because that's where Nero came from.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:58.060
And that she is immediately cremated by her household, by her slaves and freedmen in the garden and then her ashes are buried by the side of the road.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:03.060
So no big funeral?

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:31.060
No big funeral. She never got to be interred in the mausoleum of Augustus where the rest of her family were. She never got to be mourned properly and in fact because Nero told everybody that it was a plot against her that he kind of forced everybody to give thanks for her death instead of mourning her and kind of prevented people from mourning her at all.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:46.060
So she was, for really the rest of his reign, he still occasionally celebrated her birthday which is very odd but she was kind of forcibly forgotten.

01:13:46.060 --> 01:14:14.060
Which is not, I think, what she would have wanted or expected in any way. I think that when she was at the top of the Roman world, the idea that she would be buried and lost and not forgotten but would not have golden statues of her paraded through the streets and a huge wailing funeral would never have really occurred to her.

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:16.060
But that's what happened.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.060
Well at least she's on a float once a year.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:25.060
She is on a float once a year. I feel like that would probably make her happy.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:50.060
I mean on the other hand when you look at her and what she aspired to while she was alive, that she sort of had this kind of power that no woman had before her, it's probably, she cares less about being dead and more or less forgotten than she cared about not having had that power when she lived.

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:57.060
So in the end, she probably was right with having the power when she's dead. Well, she's dead.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:02.060
Yeah, and in the end she got the thing that she wanted the most, which was that her son was the emperor.

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:10.060
And it stayed, it got back into the Julian side of the family and away from the Claudian side of the family.

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:19.060
Admittedly he did end the entire lineage by being so bad at it but she couldn't have predicted that.

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:28.060
But her final achievement was that Nero got to be emperor, which he never would have without her.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:44.060
Yeah, I think the thoughts of a mother wanting to sort of doing everything that her offspring is, you know, sort of becomes either emperor or king.

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:52.060
And usually these kinds of women are the ones that are sort of reviled by the historiographers, right?

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.060
So it's like you shouldn't have ambition when you're a woman.

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:01.060
Absolutely not, even if that ambition is for your children, right?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.060
That you are still being involved in an area that only men are supposed to be in.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:16.060
And you are therefore inherently doing something that you shouldn't be doing, so you should just immediately stop.

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:27.060
And any woman that does that has to be punished in the history books and has to be reviled in order to show any future women what will happen to them if they try it.

01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:43.060
And there are no women really after Agrippina who tried to do what she did for a very long time, for like 150 years, until the Severan dynasty.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:52.060
You don't know other women tries to do what she did or tries to be as prominent and as actively powerful as she was.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:17:05.060
So it kind of works, like remembering her as this terrible villain and remembering writing about her as though she is this failure in every way,

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:15.060
as this degraded representative of everything that can go wrong, works in preventing other women from being able to do what she did.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:22.060
I mean, the historians or the historiographers, they do that with men as well.

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:29.060
But I think that the way they do it with women is like a more backhanded kind of thing, you know what I mean?

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:41.060
We actually did, or I did an episode on this Bohemian queen or empress actually from the 15th century, Barbara of Sili.

01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:55.060
And she was Holy Roman Empress and she was known as the Black Queen mainly because they said that she was like an alchemist, which was not that bad, but at least.

01:17:55.060 --> 01:18:02.060
But also that she did all these occult things and was actually a vampire.

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.060
Amazing.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:14.060
And I mean, she was very involved with all kinds of church stuff, so it's not like it was probable that she was a vampire.

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:24.060
These were all the things that were sort of attributed to her because she was in a feud with Albert II of Habsburg fame.

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:26.060
And the Habsburgs won, yeah.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:39.060
Right. And so you need to find just one who sort of plans, you know, rumours or sort of this negative connotation of the name,

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:49.060
and then it sort of through the centuries, it'll just get picked up and sort of embellished and then you have what you have with Agrippina or Barbara of Sili.

01:18:49.060 --> 01:19:01.060
Yeah, and that people are so willing to believe it as well is the thing. It is because the story of the monstrous woman is such an easily believable story to men who hate women.

01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:08.060
That it is so pleasing for people to continually tell the story.

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:11.060
And that's obviously a great story that they said she was a vampire. That's brilliant.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.060
That's the kind of story that I would tell.

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:22.060
Like you would totally repeat that if somebody said it to you about a politician. If somebody said to you, the Queen of England is a vampire, you'd be like, amazing.

01:19:22.060 --> 01:19:34.060
Which is why, yeah, exactly. Why I talk so much at the beginning of the book about the story that David Cameron fucked a pig, which was a big deal here.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:48.060
Which is, as I say, not true, true. Didn't happen. He did not have sex with a pig. But it's such a good story and it fits so well what people who don't like David Cameron think of David Cameron.

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:55.060
That he is like this big, stupid Tory who would do anything in order to be liked.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:20:05.060
And that he's massively posh and goes to parties where they have pigs' heads on the table. That it kind of doesn't matter whether it happened or not, it's too good a story not to tell.

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:16.060
And that stuck to him forever. And in like 100 years time, 200 years time, when people write biographies about David Cameron, they'll have to include it.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:20.060
You can't not write about it and not write about Pig Gate.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:28.060
I think it's probably more flattering for him to be remembered as the man who fucked a pig than the man who fucked Britain.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:35.060
That's going to be the chapter titles though, like David Cameron fucked pig, David Cameron fucked Britain.

01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:42.060
Those are going to have to be the sections in his biography forever and ever.

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:53.060
I'd say that sucks for him, but fuck him. And you get the same kind of story forever and ever.

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:58.060
For Barbara of Scilly you're just going to have to say, oh yeah, and people said she was a vampire.

01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:05.060
Because it doesn't matter whether it was true or not, it's stuck to her now because it's too good a story and it worked too well with what people wanted to think about her.

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:15.060
And people are so happy to believe stories like that about any woman in power. Like, oh yeah, she just slept away there.

01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:27.060
And an interesting connection between her and the story of Agrippina actually is that in the sources, Barbara of Scilly is called a German Messalina.

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:33.060
So they sort of directly compared it, even though she never killed anyone.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:37.060
Never married anyone while she was married to someone else.

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:45.060
Right. She was just a woman. She was quite powerful. She had her own court.

01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:52.060
Basically did what her husband did when it came to the work that a queen or a king does.

01:21:52.060 --> 01:22:00.060
But she just had too much power, so all these things were kind of invented about her.

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:08.060
And this is kind of what happens to women. Men who do power badly get tarred. So Nero does power badly.

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:16.060
He doesn't do it right, so he gets remembered as a villain. But other men do power well and they get like, you know, Trajan.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.060
Everybody loves Trajan. Everybody loves Marcus Aurelius.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:34.060
But a woman being in power, it just gets reviled for being a woman with power. She can't do it right and she can't do it wrong because she's trapped in the bind of being a woman in power.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:37.060
So she's already buggered.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.060
Now she shouldn't even have tried. Why did she even try?

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:45.060
Why did she even try? Just sheer fearlessness.

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:59.060
And it went all right for a while. And it usually does go, you know, they're remembered badly and quite often they have to deal with all the nonsense, but they still get to be in power.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:09.060
Well, the good thing about Agrippina is that, you know, finally in the year 2018, she got, you know, your book.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:11.060
She did. Finally.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:16.060
I think everything's all right again with the world of Agrippina.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:27.060
We can actually look at it in a way where we're not just influenced by whatever Tacitus decided to write about her.

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:34.060
But sort of interpret the things that were written about her or the things that were not written about her.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:48.060
And I think, I mean, we touched on that briefly in the beginning. When it comes to the sources, the really interesting thing I think is that what you mentioned as well, or not as well what you mentioned, that's why I know it,

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:55.060
that she just appears when she's there in connection with another man.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:24:01.060
And when she does something that whoever writes about her, you know, doesn't really like.

01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:08.060
Yeah, when she does something that impacts a man, then yeah, she is there and being remembered.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:12.060
And usually because she's impacting a man, she's being annoying.

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:27.060
So that, and then when she's doing stuff that doesn't directly impact in a dramatic way a man next to her, then she just vanishes completely.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:43.060
Because the sources are only written, which is why my book has had to really have the structure that it has where she is, you know, daughter, sister, niece, wife, mother, all of those are her relationship to other men.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:25:00.060
And she is all of those things, but she is also a person who is separate from those things. But that person who existed separate from being the niece, wife, mother, sister of emperors is invisible to us.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:10.060
We can only see her through those lenses of how those men impact her and how she impacts those men.

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:14.060
Anything else that she ever did is vanished because it's not interesting to Tastus.

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:24.060
Right. And I think that sort of leads us back to the beginning of our chat, which is already, I think, about an hour and a half long.

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:25.060
Yeah.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:30.060
I didn't expect it to be that long, but it's just such a gripping story.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:35.060
So I think it wouldn't do it justice to just do it in half an hour.

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:46.060
But I think we are at this point where we can say that telling the story of Agrippina in such a way the way you did it is just you doing your job as a historian.

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.060
Yeah.

01:25:47.060 --> 01:26:03.060
And just taking these sources and taking the absence of her in the sources and taking the way she's described in the sources as a concert or a mother or a daughter or a sister and interpreting it in a way that it makes sense.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:04.060
Yeah.

01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:06.060
And I think you did it very well.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.060
Thank you very much. I'm glad.

01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.060
Again.

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:29.060
It still feels a bit weird to me that this book that I wrote mostly actually in Caravan and Bondour in Donegal in Ireland in the middle of nowhere, which belongs to my partner's parents, because it has no internet out there.

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:30.060
All right.

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:38.060
And we would go down there and so much of it was just written there in a haze really or in the middle of the night up in my tiny little spare bedroom.

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:44.060
And that is now like the people are actually reading it and enjoying it is just still feels very odd.

01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.060
But it's brilliant.

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:49.060
I'm glad that people now know who Agrippina.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:54.060
All I wanted really was for people to know who she was and to think that she was great.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:00.060
Even if they don't particularly like her, she's not very likable, just be impressed by her.

01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:05.060
Well, I think the way you describe it, she's not necessarily unlikable.

01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.060
She's a complex person.

01:27:08.060 --> 01:27:09.060
Yeah.

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:16.060
And I think that's one of the takeaways of your telling of her story.

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.060
But she's all kinds of things.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:19.060
Yeah, she is.

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:21.060
Sort of a template.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.060
So thank you very much for coming on and taking that much time out.

01:27:25.060 --> 01:27:26.060
Thank you so much for having me.

01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:30.060
Your busy evening, which you'd rather spend writing.

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:33.060
Sorry that my cat decided that she wanted to also be on the podcast.

01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.060
No problem.

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.060
She was obviously jealous.

01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.060
We're a cat friendly podcast.

01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:39.060
Yeah.

01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.060
She is called Olivia.

01:27:40.060 --> 01:27:44.060
So she's Roman too.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.060
Of course.

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:46.060
She wanted to be part of that.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.060
Yeah.

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:51.060
Speaking of writing, are you working on another book?

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.060
I am working on another book.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.060
It is about Roman murder.

01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:56.060
So very different.

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.060
Very different.

01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:59.060
I decided that I wanted to do something completely different.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:02.060
I didn't want to write the same book twice.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:05.060
So I'm writing some Roman true crime now.

01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:11.060
Hopefully this week there's going to be like an official announcement from my publisher, which I'm waiting for.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:12.060
Oh, perfect.

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.060
Yeah.

01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.060
So that will be out in 2020.

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.060
So we're going to have you on again in 2020.

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:22.060
I can't even look forward to that one in about a year.

01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:27.060
I hope lots of people will read your book now, even though you basically told the whole story.

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:28.060
I didn't put all the jokes.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:29.060
There's loads of jokes in there.

01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:30.060
Right.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.060
Yeah.

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.060
It's a very funny book.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:35.060
There's lots of pop culture references in there.

01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:42.060
So if you're on Twitter or on Tumblr, you probably understand 90 percent of the jokes.

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:47.060
There's a lot of Twitter jokes in there because I spend a lot of my time on Twitter.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:49.060
Well, I do too.

01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.060
And that's why I actually saw that you had written that book.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:57.060
Otherwise I probably, you know, I saw it on Twitter historians and whatnot.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.060
And then I saw that book and I thought, that is a very good story.

01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:08.060
And then I got it already and I thought, you have to tell it on the podcast.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:10.060
Well, I hope I've done it justice.

01:29:10.060 --> 01:29:11.060
Absolutely.

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:12.060
Thanks again.

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:14.060
And well, have a good evening.

01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:15.060
And you.

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:16.060
Thank you.

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.060
I'm going to go and probably have a gin and tonic now.

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.060
Perfect.

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:23.060
And I think the perfect ending to this bonus episode about Agri Pina.

01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.060
Thanks again to Dr. Emma Southern for the chat.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:33.060
This was a bonus episode to episode 183, the regular German language episode.

01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:38.060
If you've never listened to our podcast, but you do understand German, do have a look.

01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:43.060
We have 182 other episodes already recorded.

01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:51.060
I will leave you as always with the one person who always gets the last word in this podcast, Bruno Kreisky.

01:29:51.060 --> 01:30:08.060
Lernen ist ein bisschen Geschichte. Lernen ist ein bisschen Geschichte. Dann werden Sie sehen, wie sich der Reporter damals entwickelt hat.
